    "answer": "In Aristotle's philosophy, \"eudaimonia\" refers to the supreme good for humans, often translated as \"happiness\" or \"flourishing.\" The provided text explains that \"eudaimonia\" is a Greek word that can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **eu-**: meaning \"good\" or \"well\"\n*   **daimon**: meaning \"a minor divinity\" or, better, \"guardian spirit\"\n\nSo, literally, \"eudaimonia\" suggests a state of having a good or favorable guardian spirit, which translates into a life that is going really well for someone.",

At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age",

(As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII.

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter?

If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency.

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ",
      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First compa",

The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (all) humans. • Why assume that the supreme good is the same for all of us? Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important",

It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good.

    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand the three stages of Aristotle's Function Argument. According to the course materials, the Function Argument is found in Book I, Chapter 7 of *Nichomachean Ethics*, and it proceeds in three stages:\n\n**I. The existence of a human function:**\n\n*   Aristotle starts by suggesting that craftspeople and even our body parts have specific functions.\n*   He then asks whether human beings have a function at all or if we are \"naturally functionless.\"\n*   This stage is about establishing that humans, like other things, have a characteristic activity or purpose that defines us.\n\n**II. The nature of the human function:**\n\n*   Assuming that humans *do* have a function, Aristotle explores what that function could be.\n*   He considers various activities of the human soul, drawing on his *De Anima*.\n*   He rules out activities that are not unique to humans, such as living, nutrition, growth, and sense perception, because these are shared with plants and animals.\n*   Aristotle concludes that the human function involves \"an active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle\".\n*   Therefore, \"the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational principle\".\n\n**III. The link between the human function and happiness:**\n\n*   This stage connects the human function (activity of the soul in accordance with reason) to the idea of the human good or happiness.\n*   Aristotle suggests that performing one's function well is related to virtue.\n*   The virtues enable things to perform their function well.\n*   Ultimately, he concludes that *eudaimonia*, the good for humans, is an active life of virtue.\n\nIn essence, Aristotle argues that humans have a unique function, which involves reason; that performing this function well leads to virtue; and that living a life of virtue is the key to human flourishing or happiness.",

Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are.

Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",

Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good.

    "question": "How does Socrates explain why someone might appear to desire something 'bad'?",
    "answer": "Socrates addresses the issue of why someone might appear to desire something \"bad\" by making a distinction. He differentiates between:\n\n*   **a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad.**\n*   **b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.**\n\nSocrates argues that if someone desires something bad without realizing it is bad, then they are in fact desiring something they *believe* to be good. According to the text, Socrates proposes that \"those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad. It follows that those who have no knowledge of these things and believe them to be good clearly desire good things.\"\n\nIn essence, Socrates believes that people always desire what they perceive to be good. If they choose something that is actually bad for them, it's because they are mistaken about its true nature or consequences.\n",

If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",

In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency.

Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3",

There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, others who know that the bad things harm them. And do you think that those who believe that bad things benefit them know that they are bad? No, that I cannot altogether believe. It is clear then that those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad.

To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato.

      "akness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno.

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help clarify Aristotle's three levels of potentiality and actuality, using the example of speaking Greek:\n\nAristotle uses the example of someone speaking Greek to illustrate how a capacity can exist at different levels of being realized or expressed. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **First Potentiality (1P):** This is the most basic level of capacity. It's the potential *to develop* the capacity to do something.\n    *   **Example:** An infant has the potential to learn Greek. They don't have the ability yet, but they have the inherent capacity to learn it if they undergo the necessary development and learning. In the context, the course materials state that the infant needs to \"undergo certain significant changes (learning the language)\" to actualize this potential.\n    *   **In simpler terms:** The infant has a capacity *for* a capacity.\n\n*   **Second Potentiality (2P) / First Actuality (1A):** This is the intermediate level where the capacity exists, but it's not currently being actively used. The potential from the first level has been realized.\n    *   **Example:** A person who has learned Greek and can speak it fluently, but is currently sitting quietly and not speaking. They have the *ability* to speak Greek (2P), and that ability is a kind of \"first step\" into the actual world (1A), even though they aren't using it at the moment. The course materials state that the quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to.\n    *   **In simpler terms:** The person *has* the capacity.\n\n*   **Second Actuality (2A):** This is the level where the capacity is being actively exercised.\n    *   **Example:** A person who is currently speaking Greek. They have the ability, and they are using it.\n    *   **In simpler terms:** The person is *using* the capacity.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **1P:** Potential to learn/develop a capacity.\n*   **2P/1A:** Having the capacity, but not actively using it.\n*   **2A:** Actively using the capacity.\n\nAristotle uses these distinctions to explain how things change and develop, and to define what it means for something to be alive and have a soul. The soul, in his view, is the \"first actuality\" of a living body, meaning it's what allows the body to realize its potential for life.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with.

      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A",
      "evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .",

The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ",

    "answer": "Descartes undertakes the project of systematic doubt in Meditation 1 because he believes it is necessary to establish a firm and lasting foundation for the sciences, or systematic bodies of knowledge.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **The Goal:** Descartes wants to find beliefs that are absolutely certain and unshakable, which can then serve as the foundation for all other knowledge.\n*   **The Method:** He realizes that to achieve this, he needs to \"raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations.\" This means questioning all his existing beliefs to see if they can withstand doubt.\n*   **Why Doubt?** Descartes believes that if the foundations of his beliefs are shaky, then the entire system of knowledge built upon them will also be unstable. By systematically doubting his beliefs, he hopes to identify and discard any that are unreliable.\n*   **Analogy:** The course material uses the analogy of a house with rotten timber. To make the house stable, you need to demolish it, fix the foundations, and rebuild. Descartes is doing the same with his beliefs. Another analogy is a barrel of apples, where one bad apple can rot the whole barrel. To prevent this, you need to sort through the apples and remove the rotten ones.\n*   **How much doubt?** Descartes does not think it is necessary to survey each opinion individually. Instead, he attacks the principles that support everything he once believed.\n\nIn essence, Descartes sees systematic doubt as a way to clear away any unreliable beliefs and build a solid foundation for true knowledge.\n",

The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness.

If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue.

Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot",

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things.

(6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the \"What is X?\" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to \"What is X?\" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X's, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII.

      "es, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",
      "t is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc",
      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",
      "enchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge. Although he thinks his beliefs are consistent, inconsistency is sometimes difficult to find; only diligent testing and retesting will establish their coherence. He differs from his interlocutors because he, unlike they, respect the difficulty of achieving consistency in one's beliefs. Perhaps the only thing he can say he knows with confidence is that he lacks the required assurances of consistency, and so lacks knowledge.\n\nSome may want to push this idea even further. The fact that a set of beliefs is consistent is no guarantee of their truth. As we saw above, one might gain consistency in a set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of h",
      "set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3",
      "cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea.

      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",
      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it.

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn.

      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an ani",

Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "otential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another.

This is a problem because even if we adjust our principle to say that \"if the circumstances are favorable then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses,\" we can't be sure when we are actually in favorable circumstances.\n\nIn short, optical illusions can be accounted for by acknowledging that our senses can deceive us under certain conditions, but dreaming calls into question our ability to even know whether those conditions are reliable in the first place.\n",

This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge.

      "Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense.

[‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations.

(In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) Descartes won’t be able to inspect every belief, of course. How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII.

Here's a breakdown of the difference between instrumental and final value:\n\n*   **Instrumental Value:** These are the things we value as a means to an end. Their worth is derived from what they can get us. The course material uses the example of money, which can be used to buy things like yachts. Money, in this case, has instrumental value because it helps you obtain something else.\n\n*   **Final Value:** These are the things we desire for their own sake, not as a means to something else. They are the ultimate goals or ends that we pursue. Aristotle argues that if there were no final values, our desires and actions would be \"empty and futile\" because everything would be done for the sake of something else, with no ultimate purpose.\n\nThe distinction is important because Aristotle believes that a well-ordered life is organized around a supreme good, which has final value.

Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

    "question": "What does Socrates mean by 'human wisdom' as opposed to divine knowledge?",
    "answer": "Based on the course materials, here's what Socrates means by 'human wisdom' as opposed to divine knowledge:\n\n*   **Fallibility:** Socrates emphasizes that human knowledge is fallible. This means that humans are prone to error and some of their beliefs may be false, even after careful examination. This contrasts with divine knowledge, which is infallible and free from error.\n*   **Awareness of Ignorance:** Human wisdom, according to Socrates, largely consists of an awareness of how little one actually knows. It's about recognizing the limits of one's understanding.\n*   **Humility:** Human virtue, correlated with human knowledge, involves a kind of humility. This humility stems from the recognition of one's own fallibility and limited knowledge.\n*   **Elenchus as a Tool:** Socrates sees the elenchus (his method of questioning and cross-examination) as the best tool humans have to achieve knowledge. However, even the elenchus is fallible.\n*   **Inconsistency and False Beliefs:** Through the elenchus, Socrates finds that people often hold inconsistent beliefs, which indicates they have false beliefs and lack knowledge. Socrates applies this rigorous testing to his own beliefs as well.\n*   **Human vs. Divine Virtue:** The text suggests that there's a human virtue that corresponds to human knowledge, which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge. Socrates possesses this human virtue.\n\nIn essence, Socrates' 'human wisdom' is the recognition of the limitations of human knowledge, the acceptance of fallibility, and the pursuit of truth through rigorous self-examination, always acknowledging that certainty is unattainable for humans. Divine knowledge, on the other hand, would be complete, infallible, and certain.",

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) kn",
      "ll harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue.

Socrates’ defense By engaging in philosophical inquiry, Socrates is living a virtuous life, and encouraging others to do the same; he is hardly corrupting the youth, in fact, he is the one most concerned with the state of their souls, and their virtue.

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc",
      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.

Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",

(413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions.

      "ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A",

Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .",

      "-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good.

    "question": "Explain the Socratic claim that 'no one can harm a good person.'",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down Socrates' seemingly strange claim that \"no one can harm a good person,\" based on the provided text.\n\n**The Core Idea:**\n\nSocrates doesn't mean that good people are immune to physical harm or insults. His point is about the *soul* and what truly matters for a person's well-being and happiness. He believes that a person becomes good by having knowledge, and knowledge is something that can never be taken away.\n\n**Key Points & How They Connect:**\n\n1.  **Virtue as Knowledge:** Socrates equates virtue with moral knowledge. This is a crucial foundation. If you know what is right, you will do what is right.\n2.  **The Soul's Importance:** Socrates emphasizes that the soul is of primary importance. What happens to your body or your reputation is secondary to the state of your soul.\n3.  **Harm to the Soul:** Injustice and wrongdoing harm the soul. This is the *real* harm, according to Socrates.\n4.  **Knowledge and Invulnerability:** Since virtue *is* knowledge, and knowledge cannot be taken away, then a truly good person (a person with knowledge) cannot be harmed in the way that truly matters – they cannot have their soul damaged by another. Beat me, rob me, etc., and my knowledge remains. If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then no one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n**In simpler terms:** Imagine your soul is like a garden. Virtue (knowledge) is what makes the garden flourish. Someone might come along and throw trash in your garden (insult you, steal from you, etc.). But if you have virtue (knowledge), you can clean up the trash and keep your garden healthy. The other person hasn't truly harmed *you* in a lasting way because your soul (garden) remains intact.\n\n**Why This is Surprising (and a bit controversial):**\n\n*   **It seems to contradict our everyday experience.** We see good people suffering all the time.\n*   **It downplays the importance of physical harm and external circumstances.** Most people would agree that being tortured, for example, is a serious harm, regardless of one's virtue.\n\n**Possible Objections & Socrates' Response (based on the text):**\n\n*   **But what about torturers and serial killers? Aren't they intentionally doing harm?** Socrates would argue that they are acting out of ignorance. They lack moral knowledge, and therefore, their harmful actions are not truly deliberate.\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nSocrates' claim that \"no one can harm a good person\" is a radical statement about the nature of good and harm. He's not denying that bad things can happen to good people, but he *is* arguing that true harm – the kind that damages your soul and diminishes your happiness – can only be inflicted by your own actions, not by the actions of others.\n",

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) kn",

If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising.",

The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",

In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis.

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.

      "e things and believe them to be good clearly desire good things. Is that not\nso? --It is likely.\n--Plato, Meno 77b2-e4\n\nAlthough Socrates' view that weakness of will is impossible conflicts with our ordinary experience of life, his view seems to rest on very plausible assumptions. To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato.

      "akness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno.

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

      "cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value.

    "answer": "Descartes introduces the hypothesis of an \"evil genius\" or \"malicious demon\" as a way to extend his method of doubt to its most radical extreme. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Building on Previous Doubt:** Descartes starts by questioning the reliability of the senses, noting they sometimes deceive us (like optical illusions). He then extends this doubt to the possibility that he might be dreaming, where his experiences feel real but aren't.\n\n*   **Challenging Reasoning Itself:** The \"evil genius\" hypothesis takes the doubt a step further by questioning not just the reliability of sensory experience, but also the reliability of our reasoning powers. The demon is imagined to be \"supremely powerful and clever, who has directed his entire effort at deceiving me\" (62-3).\n\n*   **Undermining Foundations:** Descartes aims to \"raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences\" (59). The evil genius attacks the very foundations of knowledge, including mathematics and logic, which might seem immune to the dream argument.\n\n*   **Radical Skepticism:** By entertaining the possibility of a malicious demon, Descartes forces himself to consider whether *everything* he believes could be false. This is a form of radical skepticism.\n\n*   **Seeking Certainty:** The purpose of this extreme doubt is to find something that *cannot* be doubted, a foundation upon which to build certain knowledge. If he can find something that even an all-powerful deceiver cannot undermine, that would be his solid foundation.\n\nIn essence, the evil genius is a tool Descartes uses to push his skepticism to its absolute limit in order to discover what, if anything, can be known with certainty.\n",

      "akness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desi",
      "no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

      "cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

    "question": "What is hylomorphism, and how does it distinguish Aristotle's view of the soul from Plato's?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you with that!\n\nBased on the course materials, here's an explanation of hylomorphism and how it relates to Aristotle's view of the soul, especially in contrast to Plato:\n\n**Hylomorphism Explained**\n\n*   **Form and Matter:** Hylomorphism is Aristotle's central idea that ordinary things are composed of two aspects:\n    *   **Matter:** This is the \"stuff\" something is made of, and Aristotle equates it with potentiality. It's the possibility of becoming something.\n    *   **Form:** This is the shape, structure, or organization that makes something a specific thing. Aristotle equates form with actuality. It's what makes the matter an actual thing.\n*   **Interdependence:** Form can only exist when it \"enforms\" matter. Matter is just potential until it takes on a form. Together, the matter/form complex creates an individual thing.\n*   **Example:** Think of a statue. The wood (or stone, etc.) is the matter, representing the potential statue. The shape imposed on the wood is the form, which makes it an actual statue.\n*   **Natural Things:** Aristotle was particularly interested in how hylomorphism explains changes, growth, and development in the natural world. The form is what makes something water, an apple tree, or a human.\n\n**Aristotle's View of the Soul vs. Plato's**\n\n*   **Plato's Dualism:** Plato believed in two separate realms: a realm of Forms (perfect, unchanging ideas) and a realm of material things (imperfect copies of the Forms). His view of the soul, as presented in the *Phaedo*, suggests dualism – that the soul is radically different from the body, separable and independent. The soul is immaterial, while the body is material.\n*   **Aristotle's Rejection of Dualism:** Aristotle rejects this dualism. He argues that the soul is not a separate substance \"trapped\" in the body. Instead, the soul is the *form* of a living body.\n*   **Hylomorphic Soul:** For Aristotle, the soul is what gives life to a living thing. It's the organization and structure that allows a body to perform its functions (nutrition, perception, thought, etc.). The body is the matter, and the soul is the form.\n*   **Interdependence of Body and Soul:** Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed the soul and body are interdependent. You can't have one without the other. The soul is not a separate entity that can exist independently of the body.\n*   **Examples/Analogies:**\n    *   **Wax and Shape:** The soul is to the body as the shape is to the wax.\n    *   **Axe and \"Account of an Axe\":** The soul is like the ability of an axe to cut. The form of the axe isn't just its shape, but its organization to perform a function.\n    *   **Eye and Sight:** The soul is like sight, which is the ability of the eye to see. Without sight, it's no longer an eye in the true sense.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nAristotle's hylomorphism offers an alternative to both dualism and materialism. He sees the soul as the form of a living body, inseparable from it and responsible for its functions. This contrasts sharply with Plato's dualistic view of the soul as a separate, immaterial entity.",

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea.

      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’).

Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God.

      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it.

      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD.

(412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal.

From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",

Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good.

For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot",

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",

Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious.

One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods.

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency.

      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",

Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

Let's break down the Prudential and Moral Paradoxes as they relate to Socrates' ideas about human action.\n\n**Prudential Paradox:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** This paradox centers around the idea that people *never* desire what is actually bad or harmful *for themselves*. If someone is pursuing something that is, in reality, bad for them, they are doing so *involuntarily*.\n*   **Underlying Assumption:** People act on their desires, and they don't desire what they *judge* to be bad for them.\n*   **The Paradox:** The paradox arises when people *do* things that are bad for them. According to the core idea, this shouldn't happen voluntarily.\n\n**Moral Paradox:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** Virtue is essentially the same thing as moral knowledge. Someone is virtuous *if and only if* they possess moral knowledge. Consequently, when people act immorally or do wrong, they do so *involuntarily*, out of ignorance.\n*   **Underlying Assumption:** If people *knew* what was truly right, they would *always* act in accordance with it.\n*   **The Paradox:** The paradox is that people commit immoral acts. If virtue is knowledge, then immoral acts must stem from a *lack* of knowledge, making them involuntary.\n\nIn essence, both paradoxes grapple with the question of why people do things that are bad (either for themselves or morally). Socrates' answer leans towards the idea that such actions are not truly voluntary but stem from a lack of knowledge or a misjudgment of what is truly good.",

Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with.

      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",

Goods and ends: some structural features (Bk I, Chs 1-2)\n\nThe overarching aim of the Nichomachean Ethics is to inquire into what makes for a good human life.\n\nIf… there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good.

They are of final value. iv.

The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action.

Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important",

It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good.

What would such a life include? He is going to argue for what may seem a surprising conclusion: the perfect human life is one which consists in activity in accordance with virtue, i.e., human excellence; this is the life of human flourishing.\n\n3.

The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7) Note that the the word translated as ‘function’ is ‘ergon .’ It could also be translated as ‘work,’ ‘business,’ ‘proper work,’ or ‘characteristic activity.’\n\nThere are three stages to the Function Argument: i. The existence of a human function (1097b28–33) ii. The nature of the human function (1097b33–1098a7) iii. The link between the human function and happiness (1098a7–20)3\n\ni.

      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ",
      " to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue.

    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand the standard pattern of Socratic Elenchus.\n\nBased on the course materials, here's a breakdown:\n\n**The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus**\n\n*   **Purpose:** The Socratic elenchus has two goals: to find truths about how to live well and to test if someone is living a moral life. So, it's both about philosophy and personal growth.\n*   **Procedure:**\n\n    1.  **Initial Assertion:** Someone (the interlocutor) makes a statement (thesis P) that Socrates thinks is wrong and wants to disprove.\n    2.  **Agreement on Further Premises:** Socrates gets the person to agree to some additional statements (premises Q and R). These aren't usually argued for, they're just accepted for the sake of the argument.\n    3.  **Socrates' Argument:** Socrates argues that if Q and R are true, then P must be false (entail not-P). The interlocutor also agrees with this argument.\n    4.  **Conclusion:** Socrates concludes that P has been proven false and not-P is true.\n\n**Example (from the Euthyphro dialogue):**\n\n*   **Question:** What is piety?\n*   **Target thesis (P):** Piety is what I am doing now, prosecuting the wrongdoer; not to prosecute is impious.\n*   **Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon:**\n\n    *   (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action.\n    *   (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\n*   **Therefore, (not-P):** Piety is not just prosecuting the wrongdoer, because prosecuting is not common to all pious actions.\n\nIn this case, Socrates tries to disprove P by showing that it clashes with Euthyphro's other beliefs (Q and R). You can't consistently say that piety is the same in all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting wrongdoers, and that prosecuting wrongdoers isn't common to all pious actions.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the Socratic Elenchus better!

For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot",

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

(6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the \"What is X?\" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to \"What is X?\" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X's, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII.

      "es, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",
      "3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R).

One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work?

Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc",
      "ous itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2",
      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",
      "enchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge. Although he thinks his beliefs are consistent, inconsistency is sometimes difficult to find; only diligent testing and retesting will establish their coherence. He differs from his interlocutors because he, unlike they, respect the difficulty of achieving consistency in one's beliefs. Perhaps the only thing he can say he knows with confidence is that he lacks the required assurances of consistency, and so lacks knowledge.\n\nSome may want to push this idea even further. The fact that a set of beliefs is consistent is no guarantee of their truth. As we saw above, one might gain consistency in a set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true.

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"
