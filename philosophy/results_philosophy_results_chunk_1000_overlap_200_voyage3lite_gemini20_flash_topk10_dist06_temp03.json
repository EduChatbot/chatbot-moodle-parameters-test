At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age",

If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ",
      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First compa",

Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important",

(ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans.

Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations.

To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato.

      "akness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno.

In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances.

And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

    "answer": "Okay, I can definitely clarify Aristotle's three levels of potentiality and actuality, using the example of speaking Greek:\n\nAristotle uses the example of someone speaking Greek to illustrate how a capacity can exist at different levels of development or realization. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **i. First Potentiality (1P):** Think of an infant. An infant has the *potential* to learn Greek. They aren't able to speak it *now*, but they have the innate capacity to develop that ability if they are exposed to the language and undergo the learning process. So, at this stage, the infant *can* speak Greek, but only in the sense that they *could* develop the ability to do so. We can say that something at the 1P stage has a capacity *for* a capacity.\n\n*   **ii. Second Potentiality (2P) / First Actuality (1A):** Now imagine someone who has learned Greek but is currently sitting quietly. They *know* Greek. They aren't speaking it at this moment, but they *can* speak it if they choose to or if someone prompts them. They've actualized the *potential* to speak Greek (they've learned the language), so they are at the stage of first actuality. But they still have the *potential* to actually speak, so they are also at the stage of second potentiality. The first potentiality (the infant's potential to learn) has been actualized, even though the speaker isn’t actually speaking.\n\n*   **iii. Second Actuality (2A):** This is when the person is *actually* speaking Greek. They are actively *exercising* their ability. This is the full realization of the potential to speak Greek.\n\n**In summary:**\n\n*   **1P:** Capacity for a capacity (infant's potential to learn)\n*   **2P/1A:** Having the capacity (knowing the language but not speaking)\n*   **2A:** Exercising the capacity (actually speaking the language)\n\nDoes that explanation help clarify the three levels?\n",

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ",
      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A",
      "evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .",

How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII.

The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",
      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3",

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ",
      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First compa",
      "ally within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1",
      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an ani",
      "ious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational "

    "question": "In Meditation 1, why does Descartes think that dreaming provides a stronger reason for doubt than simple optical illusions?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand why Descartes considers dreaming a stronger reason for doubt than optical illusions in Meditation 1.\n\nHere's the breakdown based on the provided text:\n\n*   **Optical Illusions as a Source of Doubt:** Descartes acknowledges that our senses can deceive us, citing optical illusions as an example (e.g., a stick appearing bent in water). This leads him to question the reliability of the senses as a source of knowledge.\n\n*   **The Dream Argument:** Descartes introduces the possibility that he might be dreaming. He points out that during sleep, he often has experiences indistinguishable from waking life (e.g., \"that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace\"). He argues that there are no definitive signs to distinguish being awake from being asleep.\n\n*   **Why Dreaming is a Stronger Doubt:** The key reason dreaming provides a *stronger* reason for doubt is that it undermines the very foundation of our perceptual experience *as a whole*.\n\n    *   Optical illusions are typically localized and can be corrected with further investigation or understanding of the circumstances. We can usually identify the illusion and understand why our senses were misled.\n    *   Dreaming, however, casts doubt on *all* sensory experiences. If any experience could be a dream, then we can't be certain that *any* of our perceptions accurately reflect reality. Descartes is looking for a \"sure sign\" to distinguish dreaming from waking, and he can't find one. The issue isn't just that our senses are *sometimes* wrong (as with illusions), but that they could *always* be wrong.\n\nIn essence, optical illusions are like isolated errors in our perception, while the dream argument suggests a global uncertainty about the validity of all our sensory experiences. This is why Descartes sees dreaming as a more profound and unsettling source of doubt in his quest to find a solid foundation for knowledge.\n",

      "Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had ",

Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections an",

(In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) Descartes won’t be able to inspect every belief, of course. How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII. Perception and Illusion Hypothesis: THE SENSES ARE A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nA. Whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: the senses have deceived me in the past, e.g., optical illusions (stick loo",
      "the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown” (60)). So:\n\nC. We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances; and if the circumstances are favorable then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: The “insane” can have mistaken beliefs even in ideal conditions. Sometimes individuals hallucinate. • Note that in such cases there is no external interference, but there is an internal interference in one’s perceptual processes. So we need to rule out both to have secure foundations. • Descartes refuses to consider the possibility that he is insane: “But such people are mad, and I would appear no less mad, were I to take their behavior as an example for myself.” (60).\n\nSo we should adjust the principle:\n\nDescartes, René.

What is needed is a sure sign, i.e., a sign that will\nalways be there to tell you are dreaming when you are.\n\nIV. Knowledge of A Priori Truth1 Perhaps we cannot find a sure foundation for perceptual knowledge, but there are other sorts of knowledge, e.g., knowledge of very general things (e.g. , that objects have color, shape, quantity, and so forth) and of things derived from this (e.g. , arithmetic, geometry).

In the case of dreaming, we continue to assume that the agent’s reasoning powers are intact. But what about the malicious demon? Does the malicious demon also call into question our reasoning powers? If so, then how can we carry on in rational inquiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream. Is entitled to infer that therefore all experience may be a dream? Consider a fair lottery. Any number has the same chance of winning as any other number. It is true that anyone can win the lottery.

    "answer": "In Aristotle's framework, goods and ends are categorized by their purpose in our actions. Here's the breakdown of instrumental and final value:\n\n*   **Instrumental Value:** These are the ends or goods that we desire for the sake of something else. Their value lies in their usefulness as a means to achieve another end. For example, money is typically of instrumental value because we want it to buy things like yachts or other goods and experiences.\n*   **Final Value:** These are the ends or goods that we desire for their own sake. They are not sought as a means to something else, but are valuable in themselves. Aristotle argues that if there were no final values, our desires would be \"empty and futile\" because everything would be done for the sake of something else, leading to an infinite and ultimately meaningless chain of desires.\n\nIn simpler terms, instrumental values are tools to get something else, while final values are the ultimate goals themselves.\n",

Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter.

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea.

      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A",
      "evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .",

The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7) Note that the the word translated as ‘function’ is ‘ergon .’ It could also be translated as ‘work,’ ‘business,’ ‘proper work,’ or ‘characteristic activity.’\n\nThere are three stages to the Function Argument: i.

      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ",

    "answer": "Socrates' claim that \"no one can harm a good person\" might seem strange, but here's how the course material explains it:\n\n*   **Virtue and Knowledge:** Socrates believes that being a good person depends on having knowledge, especially moral knowledge.\n*   **Knowledge is Permanent:** Once someone has knowledge, it can't be taken away, even by force or other means.\n*   **The Soul's Well-being:** Socrates emphasizes that the soul is the most important part of a person, and moral knowledge is what makes the soul healthy and happy.\n*   **True Harm:** According to Socrates, the only real harm is that which affects the soul. Since knowledge can't be taken away and is essential for the soul's well-being, no one can truly harm a good (knowledgeable) person in a way that matters.\n\nIn essence, external things like physical harm or material loss don't truly harm a good person because their soul, which is the most important thing, remains untouched and virtuous through their knowledge.",

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter?

If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man).

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising.",

If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then\nno one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks! Consider again the thesis that virtue is (moral) knowledge. It follows from this that one who lacks virtue, lacks moral knowledge, ie., is ignorant. But action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate.

    "answer": "Descartes introduces the hypothesis of an \"evil genius\" or \"malicious demon\" as a way to push his method of systematic doubt to its absolute limit. Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Building on Previous Doubt:** Descartes starts by questioning the reliability of the senses, noting they sometimes deceive us (like optical illusions). He then extends this doubt to the possibility that he might be dreaming, which could mean that his sensory experiences don't reflect reality.\n\n*   **Challenging Reasoning Itself:** The evil genius hypothesis takes the doubt a step further. It suggests that there might be a supremely powerful and clever being whose sole purpose is to deceive Descartes about everything, including things that seem most certain, such as mathematical truths or logical principles.\n\n*   **Undermining Foundations of Knowledge:** Descartes believes that to establish firm and lasting knowledge, he needs to examine the foundations upon which his beliefs are built. If those foundations can be shaken, then everything built upon them becomes uncertain. The evil genius is a tool to attack the very foundations of his knowledge by questioning the reliability of his reasoning powers.\n\n*   **Seeking Absolute Certainty:** By imagining the most radical scenario for doubt, Descartes hopes to find something that even an evil genius could not undermine. If he can discover a belief that is immune to even this extreme form of deception, then he can be certain of its truth. This is the starting point for rebuilding his system of knowledge on a solid foundation.\n\nIn essence, the evil genius is a philosophical device that Descartes uses to explore the limits of skepticism and to search for an unshakable foundation for knowledge.\n",

    "question": "What is hylomorphism, and how does it distinguish Aristotle's view of the soul from Plato's?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you understand hylomorphism and how it relates to Aristotle's view of the soul, especially in contrast to Plato.\n\n**What is Hylomorphism?**\n\nHylomorphism is a philosophical theory developed by Aristotle that explains reality in terms of two fundamental principles: matter and form. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Matter:** Matter is the \"stuff\" of which a thing is made. It's potentiality, meaning it has the potential to become something. Think of it as raw material.\n*   **Form:** Form is what gives a thing its structure, organization, and essence. It's what makes a thing what it is, defining its actuality. Form \"enforms\" matter, shaping it into a specific thing.\n\nAristotle uses the example of a statue to illustrate this: The wood is the matter (potential statue), and the shape is the form (which makes it an actual statue). The statue itself is the matter/form complex, the individual thing.\n\n**Aristotle's View of the Soul (psuchē) in Relation to Hylomorphism**\n\nAristotle applies hylomorphism to living things, including humans, to explain the nature of the soul:\n\n*   **Soul as Form, Body as Matter:** For living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form. The soul is the \"form of a natural body having life potentially within it.\" In other words, the soul is what organizes the body and gives it the capacity to live, grow, perceive, and think (depending on the kind of living thing).\n*   **Interdependence:** Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed that the soul and body are interdependent. You wouldn't have one without the other. The soul needs the body to exist and carry out its functions, and the body needs the soul to be alive and organized.\n*   **Soul as Ability:** The soul is a certain kind of ability. To be an axe is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue) but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. Likewise for the soul.\n*As the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the animal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\n**How Aristotle's View Differs from Plato's**\n\nThe key difference lies in their understanding of the relationship between the soul and the body:\n\n*   **Plato's Dualism:** Plato, as presented in the *Phaedo*, held a dualistic view. He believed that the soul and body are radically different and separable. The soul is immaterial and can exist independently of the body. In fact, Plato thought the soul was imprisoned in the body and longed to be free.\n*   **Aristotle's Rejection of Dualism:** Aristotle rejected this dualism. He argued that the soul is not a separate substance but rather the form or organization of the body. The soul cannot exist without the body, just as the form of a statue cannot exist without the matter (e.g., wood or bronze).\n\n**In Summary**\n\nHylomorphism is the foundation for Aristotle's understanding of the soul. He sees the soul as the form of a living body, inseparable from it and responsible for its life functions. This contrasts sharply with Plato's dualistic view of the soul as a separate, immaterial entity.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the concept of hylomorphism and its significance in understanding Aristotle's view of the soul! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea.

      "t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.",
      "r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First compa",

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1",
      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an ani",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se",
      "human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational "

    "question": "Describe the 'Prudential Paradox' and the 'Moral Paradox' regarding Socratic views on action.",
    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you with that! Let's break down the Prudential and Moral Paradoxes as they relate to Socrates' views on action, based on the information you've provided.\n\n**Prudential Paradox:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** This paradox centers on the idea that people don't knowingly desire what is bad or harmful *for themselves*. If someone pursues something bad or harmful, it must be involuntary.\n*   **In simpler terms:** We always aim for what we *think* is good for us. If we end up doing something that hurts us, it's because we were mistaken about what was truly good for us.\n*   **Example:** Imagine someone who overeats despite knowing it's unhealthy. According to the prudential paradox, they don't *really* desire the harm; they are either misinformed about the extent of the harm or are prioritizing some other perceived benefit (like the immediate pleasure of eating) over their long-term health.\n\n**Moral Paradox:**\n\n*   **Core Idea:** This paradox links virtue with knowledge. To be virtuous, one must possess moral knowledge. Consequently, immoral actions are always involuntary, stemming from ignorance.\n*   **In simpler terms:** People act wrongly because they don't *know* what is right. If they had true moral knowledge, they would always act virtuously.\n*   **Example:** Someone who steals might do so because they don't fully grasp the moral implications of theft or because they lack a true understanding of justice and fairness. If they *really* understood that stealing harms their own soul and the community, they wouldn't do it.\n\n**Connection & Significance:**\n\n*   Both paradoxes highlight Socrates' emphasis on the role of knowledge in guiding human action. He believed that people fundamentally desire what is good (whether for themselves or morally), and any deviation from this path is due to a lack of understanding or awareness.\n*   The text suggests that the prudential paradox remains even if we accept that people act on their desires and don't desire what they *judge* to be bad for them.\n*   The text also raises the question of whether we should take the moral paradox seriously, particularly if we assume that doing the right thing is actually in our self-interest.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the two paradoxes for you.

Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn't allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d).

      "cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act",

On one hand things which\nare harmful, or against our self-interest are bad for us; on the other hand things may be judged morally\ngood or bad. If we are sensitive to this distinction we may see that the argument can be divided into two different conclusions:\n\nIf I judge that an action is best for me, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it. If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value.

This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are.

But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God.

Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important",

It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good.

Aristotle wants to know, what are the constituents of a happy life? (1097b22–24) What does it take to be happy, truly happy? Can we characterize the life of complete human flourishing? What would such a life include? He is going to argue for what may seem a surprising conclusion: the perfect human life is one which consists in activity in accordance with virtue, i.e., human excellence; this is the life of human flourishing.\n\n3.

Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

    "question": "What is the 'Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus' used to refute a thesis?",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down the standard pattern of Socratic Elenchus. Based on the course material you've provided, here's how it works:\n\n**The Socratic Elenchus: A Step-by-Step Refutation**\n\nThe Socratic Elenchus is a method Socrates uses to examine someone's moral beliefs, with the aim of discovering truths and testing if the person is living a moral life. It's both a philosophical and therapeutic tool. Here's the procedure:\n\n1.  **Initial Assertion (P):** The person Socrates is questioning (the interlocutor) states a thesis or belief (P) that Socrates thinks is wrong and wants to disprove.\n2.  **Agreement on Further Premises (Q, R, etc.):** Socrates gets the interlocutor to agree to some additional statements or premises (Q, R, and so on). Importantly, these premises are usually *not* argued for at this point; they are simply accepted by the interlocutor.\n3.  **Entailment of the Opposite (Not-P):** Socrates then argues that those agreed-upon premises (Q and R) logically lead to the opposite of the original thesis (Not-P). In other words, Socrates tries to show that if Q and R are true, then P must be false.\n4.  **Claim of Refutation:** Socrates concludes that the original thesis (P) has been proven false, and its opposite (Not-P) is true.\n\n**Example from the Euthyphro Dialogue**\n\nLet's use the example from the Euthyphro dialogue to illustrate:\n\n*   **Question:** What is piety and impiety?\n*   **Target thesis (P):** \"The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious.\" (Euthyphro believes piety is prosecuting his father for wrongdoing).\n*   **Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon:**\n    *   **(Q):** \"The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action.\" (Piety has a common characteristic).\n    *   **(R):** \"There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\" (Prosecuting wrongdoers isn't the *only* pious action).\n*   **Therefore, (not-P):** \"Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting is not common to all pious actions).\"\n\n**In essence, Socrates aims to show that Euthyphro's definition of piety conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds.** You can't consistently say that piety is a single action (prosecuting wrongdoers), while also agreeing that piety has a common characteristic across *all* pious actions and that there are other pious actions besides just prosecuting wrongdoers.\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Inconsistency:** The core of the elenchus is exposing inconsistency in the interlocutor's beliefs.\n*   **Fallibility:** The text emphasizes that this method doesn't guarantee absolute certainty. It's possible to reject a true belief during the process. Socrates acknowledges the fallibility of human knowledge.\n*   **Socrates' Disavowal of Knowledge:** Socrates often claims to not have knowledge himself. This might be because he recognizes that his own beliefs are also subject to this process of elenctic inquiry and potential inconsistency.\n*   **Purpose:** The Socratic Elenchus is meant to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the standard pattern of the Socratic Elenchus! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot",

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

(6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the \"What is X?\" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to \"What is X?\" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X's, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII.

One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods.

But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge.",

Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"
