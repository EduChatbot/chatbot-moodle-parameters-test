      "Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) "

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima.

[Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good.

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on",

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1",
      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)...

(413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn",
      "evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

    "question": "Explain Aristotle's reasoning for why a well-ordered life must be organized around a single 'supreme good'.",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down Aristotle's argument for why a well-ordered life needs to be organized around a single \"supreme good,\" based on the provided text.\n\nHere's the core of his reasoning:\n\n1.  **Humans are goal-oriented:** We naturally engage in activities aimed at achieving certain ends or goals.\n2.  **Instrumental vs. Final Ends:** Some of these goals (ends) are pursued as a means to achieve something else. For example, we might pursue money (an instrumental value) to buy a yacht. However, other goals seem to be pursued for their own sake (final value).\n3.  **The Problem of Infinite Regression:** Aristotle argues that if *everything* we desire is for the sake of something else, and this process goes on infinitely, then our desires would be \"empty and vain.\" In other words, if there's no ultimate goal that gives purpose to our actions, then our actions become meaningless.\n4.  **The Need for a Supreme Good:** To avoid this infinite regression and give our lives meaning and direction, Aristotle posits the need for a supreme good. This supreme good is the ultimate goal that we desire for its own sake, and for the sake of which we order all our other desires and actions.\n5. **Resolving Conflicting Ends**: Practical reason allows us to achieve many ends in life. However, when these ends conflict, we need a way to prioritize them. A supreme good provides a standard for ranking our ends, allowing us to make rational decisions when faced with conflicting desires or goals.\n6.  **Happiness as the Supreme Good:** Aristotle identifies happiness (or \"eudaimonia,\" often translated as \"flourishing\") as the supreme good. He argues that happiness is:\n    *   **Final:** Chosen for its own sake, not as a means to something else.\n    *   **Complete:** Aimed for purely as an end.\n    *   **Self-sufficient:** A happy life lacks nothing.\n\nIn essence, Aristotle believes that without a supreme good like happiness to guide our choices and actions, our lives would lack purpose and direction. The supreme good provides a framework for making rational decisions and living a well-ordered life.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify Aristotle's reasoning. Let me know if you have any further questions or would like me to elaborate on any of these points!\n",

In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē.

      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on",
      "Aristotle on Happiness Nichomachean Ethics, Book I\n\n1. Goods and ends: some structural features (Bk I, Chs 1-2)\n\nThe overarching aim of the Nichomachean Ethics is to inquire into what makes for a good human life.\n\nIf… there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good.

(1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .\nii. Some of the ends (e.g., money) are for the sake of other ends (e.g., yachts). They are of instrumental value. iii. Other ends don’t seem to be for the sake of other things. They are of final value. iv. If there are no things of final value, the considerations motivating our choices “will go on without limit, so that desire will prove to be empty and futile” (1094a20–21). • Note: this observation alone doesn’t establish that there is only one final good. iv. The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (all) humans. • Why assume that the supreme good is the same for all of us? Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important features that seem to make it uniquely suited to be the supreme good. It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good. Everyone may agree on this,\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press.

The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7) Note that the the word translated as ‘function’ is ‘ergon .’ It could also be translated as ‘work,’ ‘business,’ ‘proper work,’ or ‘characteristic activity.’\n\nThere are three stages to the Function Argument: i. The existence of a human function (1097b28–33) ii. The nature of the human function (1097b33–1098a7) iii. The link between the human function and happiness (1098a7–20)3\n\ni.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

    "question": "Describe Descartes' 'Dream Argument' and explain why he believes there is no 'sure sign' of being awake.",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down Descartes' \"Dream Argument\" and his reasons for claiming there's no \"sure sign\" to distinguish wakefulness from dreaming.\n\n**The Dream Argument Explained**\n\nThe Dream Argument is a key part of Descartes' method of doubt in his *Meditations on First Philosophy*. He's trying to find a foundation of certainty for knowledge, and to do that, he systematically questions all his beliefs. Here's how the Dream Argument unfolds:\n\n1.  **The Initial Doubt:** Descartes starts by acknowledging that his senses sometimes deceive him (like a stick appearing bent in water).\n2.  **Favorable Circumstances:** He considers the idea that maybe the senses are only unreliable in *unfavorable* circumstances. Perhaps when conditions are good, what we perceive is accurate. He initially thinks he can tell when circumstances are favorable (e.g., \"sitting here next to the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown\").\n3.  **The Dream Doubt:** This is where the Dream Argument comes in. Descartes realizes that when he dreams, he often has experiences that are very similar to waking life. He vividly believes he is in a certain place, doing certain things, even though he's actually asleep in bed.\n4.  **The Problem:** Descartes' point is that there's no definitive way to distinguish dreaming from being awake *while* you're experiencing it.\n\n**Why No \"Sure Sign\"?**\n\nDescartes addresses a potential objection:\n\n*   **Objection:** \"Dreams have a 'dream-like quality.'\" We can tell the difference.\n*   **Descartes' Response:** This objection fails for a couple of reasons:\n\n    *   **(i) Retrospective Recognition:** Often, the \"dream-like quality\" is only apparent *after* you wake up and remember the dream. It's not a reliable sign *during* the dream.\n    *   **(ii) Not Always Present:** Dreams don't *always* have a bizarre or surreal quality. Some dreams feel very realistic.\n\n**The Need for a \"Sure Sign\"**\n\nDescartes is looking for a criterion that *always* works to distinguish dreaming from wakefulness. He wants a sign that will *always* be present to tell you that you are dreaming *while* you are dreaming. Since he can't find such a sign, he concludes that any given experience *might* be a dream.\n\n**Important Note:** The text raises the question of whether, having established that *any* given experience might be a dream, Descartes is entitled to infer that *all* experience may be a dream. The text suggests an analogy with a lottery to raise questions about the validity of this inference.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify Descartes' Dream Argument! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3",
      "Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) ",

(In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) Descartes won’t be able to inspect every belief, of course. How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII. Perception and Illusion Hypothesis: THE SENSES ARE A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nA. Whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: the senses have deceived me in the past, e.g., optical illusions (stick looks bent when partly submerged). •\nNote that the counter-examples to (A) are examples of external interference in our perceptual processes. It\nseems that they occur only in unfavorable circumstances. Can we adjust the principle?\n\nB. If the circumstances are favorable, then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: Suppose B is true, but you can never tell when circumstances are favorable. Then you couldn’t draw the conclusion that things are as they appear. But, the naïf argues, of course we can sometimes tell that we are in favorable conditions (e.g. , “sitting here next to the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown” (60)). So:\n\nC. We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances; and if the circumstances are favorable then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: The “insane” can have mistaken beliefs even in ideal conditions.

Sometimes individuals hallucinate. • Note that in such cases there is no external interference, but there is an internal interference in one’s perceptual processes. So we need to rule out both to have secure foundations. • Descartes refuses to consider the possibility that he is insane: “But such people are mad, and I would appear no less mad, were I to take their behavior as an example for myself.” (60).\n\nSo we should adjust the principle:\n\nDescartes, René.

We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances, and competent from incompetent perceivers; and if circumstances are favorable and the perceiver is competent, then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: Even competent perceivers sometimes have vivid dreams. And “there are no definitve signs by which to distinguish being awake from being asleep” (60).\n\nHow often does my evening slumber persuade me of such ordinary things as these: that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace – when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! (60)\n\nDescartes’ point is that there is no “sure sign” based on the qualitative experience of dreaming that I am awake and not dreaming. • You might protest: Of course I can tell the difference between dreams and waking experience! Dreams\nhave a “dream-like quality.” And of course I can tell once I wake up I know I was dreaming before.\n•\nBut the claim that dreams have a ‘dream-like quality’ is of no use against the skeptical argument, if (i) the\n‘dream-like quality’ is only noticed once you wake up and remember what the dream was like, or (ii)\ndreams don’t always have the ‘dream-like quality’. What is needed is a sure sign, i.e., a sign that will\nalways be there to tell you are dreaming when you are.\n\nIV. Knowledge of A Priori Truth1 Perhaps we cannot find a sure foundation for perceptual knowledge, but there are other sorts of knowledge, e.g., knowledge of very general things (e.g. , that objects have color, shape, quantity, and so forth) and of things derived from this (e.g. , arithmetic, geometry).

(62-3)\n\nCould a malicious demon not only undermine our confidence in experience of the external world, but also confidence in our reasoning about general things? It seems so, for the naïf concludes:\n\nBut eventually I am forced to admit that there is nothing among the things I once believed to be true which it is not permissible to doubt – and not out of frivolity or lack of forethought, but for valid and considered reasons. (62)\n\nQuestions: 1. Note that Descartes dismisses madness as a source of error and replaces it with dreaming. Why? One possibility is that the insane are not only confused about their experiences, but have defective reasoning powers. In the case of dreaming, we continue to assume that the agent’s reasoning powers are intact. But what about the malicious demon? Does the malicious demon also call into question our reasoning powers? If so, then how can we carry on in rational inquiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream.

      "24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocratic Definition and the Elenchus\n\nI. Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it",
      " piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the \"What is X?\" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to \"What is X?\" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X's, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R.

      "3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods.

Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false?

    "question": "How does Aristotle use the comparison of an axe to illustrate his concept of the soul?",
    "answer": "Aristotle uses the analogy of an axe to explain his concept of the soul as a specific kind of ability or function, not a separate entity as proposed by dualists like Plato. Here's how the comparison works:\n\n*   **Essence and Function:** Aristotle suggests that if an axe were a natural object, its \"soul\" would be its essence – what it means to be an axe. The essence of an axe is defined by its ability to cut wood.\n*   **Form and Ability:** The form of the axe isn't just its shape, but how that shape is organized to perform its function (cutting). If an axe loses its ability to cut, it essentially ceases to be an axe, except in name only.\n*   **Soul as Ability:** Similarly, Aristotle argues that the soul is not a mysterious, separate entity, but the ability of a living thing to perform its characteristic functions. Just as the ability to cut is inseparable from the axe's form and material, the soul is inseparable from the body.\n\nIn essence, the axe analogy highlights Aristotle's view that the soul is the form or structure that enables a body to perform its specific functions, rejecting the idea of the soul as an independent, immaterial substance.",

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on",

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1",
      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)...

(413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn"

Here's a breakdown of his reasoning, based on the provided text:\n\n*   **The Core Argument:** Socrates posits that if someone desires something that is actually bad, it's because they *believe* it to be good in some way. He distinguishes between:\n\n    *   Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad.\n    *   Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\n*   **Belief and Desire:** Socrates argues that people never knowingly desire what is bad. If someone desires something harmful, it's because they are mistaken and believe it will bring them some benefit or good. The text states, \"those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad.\"\n\n*   **The Goal of Good:** Ultimately, Socrates believes everyone is striving for what they perceive to be the \"good.\" Even if they choose a path that leads to negative consequences, their intention was to achieve something positive.\n\nIn essence, Socrates links our evaluations with our desires, suggesting that we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances.",

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set.

      "24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocrates on Weakness of Will\n\nOne of Socrates' most puzzling views is the claim that akrasia, or weakness of will, is impossible. We seem to encounter weakness of will on a daily basis. What is weakness of will? Standardly, cases of weakness of will are characterized as those in which one knows or believes that a certain action is better than another, but voluntarily does the worse action instead.\n\nThere seem to be many ways this can occur. For example, in spite of my judgment that it is best not to have a cigarette with my morning coffee, I may nevertheless go ahead and indulge, while continuing to think that the best thing for me to do would be to forego it. Or, in spite of my judgment that it would be far better for me to give my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, o",
      "the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, others who know that the bad things harm them. And do you think that those who believe that bad things benefit them know that they are bad? No, that I cannot altogether believe. It is clear then that those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad. It follows that those who have no knowledge of these things and believe them to be good clearly desire good things. Is that not\nso? --It is likely.\n--Plato, Meno 77b2-e4\n\nAlthough Socrates' view that weakness of will is impossible conflicts with our ordinary experience of life, his view seems to rest on very plausible assumptions. To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n1",
      "We can then add a further premise to connect this to action:\n\n2) If I desire to perform or avoid an action, and it is in my power to do so, then I will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3) If an action is good, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it; and if an action is bad, and it is in my power to avoid it, then I will avoid it.\n\nBut if these conclusions are correct, then if an action is bad, and I perform it anyway, it must not have been in my power to avoid it, i.e., I must have done it involuntarily. So bad action is never voluntary.\n\nThis argument lacks plausibility as it stands because the premise from the Meno Socrates relies on (i.e., (1) above) isn’t obviously true. Moreover, (3) seems to be a much stronger conclusion than the thesis that weakness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will d",
      "no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an action is good, and it is in one's power to perform it, then one will perform it;\nand if one believes that the action is bad, and it is in one's power to avoid it, then one will avoid it.\n\n2"

Let's break down the key differences between Plato and Aristotle's views on the relationship between the body and soul, based on the provided text.\n\n**Plato:**\n\n*   **Dualism:** The text mentions that Plato's *Phaedo* \"seems to offer a version of dualism,\" which means he saw the soul and body as radically different and separable. The soul is immaterial, while the body is material.\n\n**Aristotle:**\n\n*   **Rejection of Dualism:** Aristotle rejects the idea that the soul and body are independent.\n*   **Hylomorphism:** Instead, he proposes hylomorphism. This is the idea that the soul is the *form* of the body, and the body is the *matter*. They are interdependent and cannot exist without each other, contrary to Plato's view.\n*   **Soul as the 'form of a natural body having life potentially within it':** For Aristotle, the soul is what gives life to a living thing. It's not a separate entity *inside* the body, but rather the organization and structure that makes the body a living thing.\n*   **Comparisons to Explain the Relationship:** Aristotle uses several comparisons to illustrate the soul-body relationship:\n    *   **Wax and its shape:** The soul is to the body as the shape is to the wax. You can't have a shape without some matter to give it that shape, and the matter is only that specific thing once it has a shape.\n    *   **Axe and 'the account of an axe':** The soul is like the function or purpose of an axe (to cut). An axe is only an axe because of its ability to cut; without that ability, it's just wood and steel.\n    *   **Eye and Sight:** The soul is like sight, which is the ability of the eye to see.

      "24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the",

(As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1",
      "d) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn't allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says \"Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly....\" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (\"death is something I couldn't care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious\" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\"(38a)? How are they connected? What's wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god.

      "Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist",
      "In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on",

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn.

      "This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)...

(413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn",

    "question": "Trace the logical progression from the Socratic thesis 'Virtue is Knowledge' to the conclusion that 'No one does harm deliberately'.",
    "answer": "Okay, let's break down how the course material connects Socrates' idea that \"virtue is knowledge\" to the conclusion that \"no one does harm deliberately.\"\n\nHere's the logical progression, based on the provided text:\n\n1.  **Virtue is Knowledge:** The core idea is that being virtuous (morally good) is the same as having moral knowledge. If you truly *know* what is right, you will *be* virtuous. (See section \"I. Recap of some Socratic theses:\" and point (c))\n\n2.  **Lack of Virtue Implies Lack of Knowledge (Ignorance):** If someone *lacks* virtue, then, according to Socrates, they *must* also lack moral knowledge. In other words, they are ignorant of what is truly good. (See section \"6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks!\")\n\n3.  **Harmful Actions Stem from a Lack of Virtue:** When someone does something harmful, it's a sign that they are failing to be virtuous. (See section \"6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks!\")\n\n4.  **Harmful Actions Stem from Ignorance:** Because a failure of virtue is also a failure of knowledge, doing harm *must* come from a place of ignorance. People who do bad things, according to Socrates, simply don't know what they are doing is truly bad (for themselves, for their souls). (See section \"6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks!\")\n\n5.  **Actions Based on Ignorance are Involuntary (Not Deliberate):** Here's the crucial step. The text states that \"action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate.\" If someone is acting out of ignorance, they aren't truly *choosing* to do harm in full knowledge of what they are doing. Their action is, in a sense, involuntary. (See section \"6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks!\")\n\n6.  **Therefore, No One Deliberately Does Harm:** This is the conclusion. Since all harmful actions stem from ignorance, and actions based on ignorance are involuntary, it follows that no one *deliberately* chooses to do harm. People only do harm because they *think* they are pursuing something good, or because they are ignorant of the true consequences of their actions. (See section \"6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks!\")\n\nIn essence, Socrates is arguing that people always pursue what they *believe* to be good. If they do something that appears harmful, it's only because they are mistaken about what is truly good.\n\n",

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising...but on Socrates' view a person becomes good by virtue of having knowledge, moreover, knowledge is something one can never be deprived of once one has it.

If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then\nno one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n6.

If doing harm is a failure of virtue, it must also be a failure of knowlege, and so be involuntary. (We will consider this in greater depth in connection with the Meno.)\n\nV. Socrates’ defense By engaging in philosophical inquiry, Socrates is living a virtuous life, and encouraging others to do the same; he is hardly corrupting the youth, in fact, he is the one most concerned with the state of their souls, and their virtue.

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn't allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says \"Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly....\" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (\"death is something I couldn't care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious\" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\"(38a)? How are they connected? What's wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco",

Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it",
      "set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3",
      "24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocrates on Weakness of Will\n\nOne of Socrates' most puzzling views is the claim that akrasia, or weakness of will, is impossible. We seem to encounter weakness of will on a daily basis. What is weakness of will? Standardly, cases of weakness of will are characterized as those in which one knows or believes that a certain action is better than another, but voluntarily does the worse action instead.\n\nThere seem to be many ways this can occur. For example, in spite of my judgment that it is best not to have a cigarette with my morning coffee, I may nevertheless go ahead and indulge, while continuing to think that the best thing for me to do would be to forego it. Or, in spite of my judgment that it would be far better for me to give my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, o",
      "no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: \"it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good.\" But once we've modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one's power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an action is good, and it is in one's power to perform it, then one will perform it;\nand if one believes that the action is bad, and it is in one's power to avoid it, then one will avoid it.\n\n2",
      "This argument is more plausible than our initial (1)-(3) and doesn’t entail that wrongdoing is always\ninvoluntary. But this argument still yields a conclusion which denies weakness of will, which is also problematic. What are we to do? All of the premises seem plausible, but they are inconsistent with the common sense claim that:\n\nSometimes I judge an action to be overall best, and nevertheless fail to perform it.\n\nIII. Possible responses:\n\n• As a matter of fact, weakness of will is impossible. Ordinary cases are not what they may seem, i.e.,\n(3*) is unproblematic.\n• The premise that we always desire what we judge best is false; judgment and desire is not linked in\nthis way, i.e., (1*) is false.\n•\nThe premise that we always act on our desires (where possible) is false, i.e., (2*) is false.\n\nDivide and Conquer? So far we have not distinguished different ways that something can be bad. On one hand things which\nare harmful, or against our self-interest are bad for us; on the other hand things may be judged morally\ngood or bad. If we are sensitive to this distinction we may see that the argument can be divided into two different conclusions:\n\nIf I judge that an action is best for me, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it. If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value. Ie., our desires may be responsive to other concerns besides moral value. But this in fact suggests that there are two paradoxical ideas at stake:\n\nPrudential paradox:\n\nNo one desires what's bad or harmful (for oneself).

    "question": "Synthesize Aristotle's 'Function Argument' with his criteria for 'eudaimonia' to explain why the perfect life consists of activity in accordance with virtue.",
    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you synthesize Aristotle's Function Argument with his criteria for eudaimonia to explain why, according to him, the perfect human life consists of activity in accordance with virtue.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. The Function Argument:**\n\n*   **The Core Idea:** Aristotle believes that to understand what's good for something, you need to understand its function (\"ergon,\" which can also mean work, business, or characteristic activity).\n*   **Steps of the Argument:**\n\n    *   **Existence of a Human Function:** Aristotle argues that just like craftspeople and body parts have specific functions, so do human beings. He asks if humans are \"naturally functionless.\"\n    *   **Nature of the Human Function:** Aristotle explores various activities of the human soul (drawing on his psychology from *De Anima*), but rules out those shared with other living things (like nutrition, growth, and sense perception). He concludes that the unique function of humans involves \"an active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle\" (1098a3-4). So, the human function is \"activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational principle\" (1098a7-8).\n    *   **Link to Happiness:** Aristotle connects performing one's function well with achieving the human good. Virtues are the capacities that enable things to perform their function well. Therefore, human virtues are those capacities that enable humans to live a life of rational activity well. This leads to the conclusion that \"the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete\" (1098a16–18).\n\n**2. Criteria for Eudaimonia (Happiness/Flourishing):**\n\n*   **Eudaimonia:** Aristotle equates the good for humans with *eudaimonia*, which is often translated as \"happiness\" or \"flourishing.\" It means that things are going really well for someone.\n*   **Key Features of Eudaimonia:**\n\n    *   **Final:** Chosen for its own sake, not as a means to something else.\n    *   **Complete:** Aimed for purely as an end.\n    *   **Self-sufficient:** A life that lacks nothing.\n\n**3. Synthesis: The Perfect Life of Virtue**\n\n*   **The Connection:** Aristotle argues that *eudaimonia* is achieved through living a life of virtue.\n*   **How it Works:**\n\n    *   Humans have a specific function: to live a life of rational activity.\n    *   To live this life well (to perform our function excellently), we need virtues (good character traits/excellences).\n    *   When we actively exercise these virtues in accordance with reason throughout our lives, we achieve *eudaimonia*, the highest good for humans.\n\nIn essence, Aristotle believes that the perfect human life isn't just about feeling good or having pleasure. It's about actively developing and using our rational and moral capacities to live a life of virtue, thereby fulfilling our unique human function and achieving genuine flourishing.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the connection between the Function Argument and Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

(As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1",
      "d) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer? Socrates claims to have human knowle",
      " capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn",

Goods and ends: some structural features (Bk I, Chs 1-2)\n\nThe overarching aim of the Nichomachean Ethics is to inquire into what makes for a good human life.\n\nIf… there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good.

(1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .\nii. Some of the ends (e.g., money) are for the sake of other ends (e.g., yachts). They are of instrumental value. iii. Other ends don’t seem to be for the sake of other things. They are of final value. iv. If there are no things of final value, the considerations motivating our choices “will go on without limit, so that desire will prove to be empty and futile” (1094a20–21). • Note: this observation alone doesn’t establish that there is only one final good. iv. The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important features that seem to make it uniquely suited to be the supreme good. It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good. Everyone may agree on this,\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

The function of humans is to lead a certain kind of life, and excellent humans (good people) are those who do that well. “And so the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue.

Through the Function Argument, he determines that the unique human function is 'activity of the soul in accord with reason'. Because the virtue of a thing is what enables it to perform its function well, the human good (happiness) must specifically be an 'activity of the soul in accord with excellence' or virtue. Therefore, the life of flourishing is one spent actively exercising human excellence.",

    "question": "How does the distinction between 'external interference' and 'internal interference' structure Descartes' skeptical progression in Meditation 1?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand how the distinction between 'external interference' and 'internal interference' shapes Descartes' argument in Meditation 1.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Initial Reliance on Senses:** Descartes begins by considering the idea that our senses are a reliable source of knowledge. The initial assumption is that whatever we perceive accurately reflects reality.\n*   **External Interference:** Descartes quickly introduces the problem of sensory illusions. For example, a stick appearing bent in water. These illusions are caused by *external interference* – something in the environment distorts the sensory input. To address this, Descartes refines his principle, suggesting that our senses are reliable when circumstances are favorable.\n*   **Internal Interference:** However, Descartes then considers the possibility of \"the insane\" or those who hallucinate. In these cases, the problem isn't an external distortion, but an *internal interference* within the individual's perceptual processes. Even under seemingly ideal external conditions, their perceptions can be radically mistaken.\n\nIn essence, Descartes uses this distinction to escalate his doubt. He moves from questioning whether external factors can distort our perceptions to questioning whether our own minds can distort them, regardless of external conditions. This progression weakens the foundation of knowledge derived from the senses.\n",

      "Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) ",

(In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) Descartes won’t be able to inspect every belief, of course. How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII. Perception and Illusion Hypothesis: THE SENSES ARE A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nA. Whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: the senses have deceived me in the past, e.g., optical illusions (stick looks bent when partly submerged). •\nNote that the counter-examples to (A) are examples of external interference in our perceptual processes. It\nseems that they occur only in unfavorable circumstances. Can we adjust the principle?\n\nB. If the circumstances are favorable, then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: Suppose B is true, but you can never tell when circumstances are favorable. Then you couldn’t draw the conclusion that things are as they appear. But, the naïf argues, of course we can sometimes tell that we are in favorable conditions (e.g. , “sitting here next to the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown” (60)). So:\n\nC. We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances; and if the circumstances are favorable then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: The “insane” can have mistaken beliefs even in ideal conditions.

So we need to rule out both to have secure foundations. • Descartes refuses to consider the possibility that he is insane: “But such people are mad, and I would appear no less mad, were I to take their behavior as an example for myself.” (60).\n\nSo we should adjust the principle:\n\nDescartes, René.

To find a secure foundation, he adjusts his principle to assume circumstances are favorable.

This leads him to distinguish competent from incompetent perceivers, eventually arriving at the dream argument where no internal or external sign can guarantee competence in distinguishing waking life from sleep.",

    "answer": "Okay, I can help you break down how Socrates reconciles his \"disavowal of knowledge\" with his claim to \"human wisdom\" through the elenchus.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key ideas:\n\n*   **Socrates' Disavowal of Knowledge:** Socrates frequently claims that he doesn't have knowledge. This is a central tenet in the Apology, where he interprets the Oracle at Delphi as saying that he is the wisest of men because he alone knows that he knows nothing.\n\n*   **The Elenchus:** This is the Socratic method of inquiry, also sometimes referred to as 'Elenchtic inquiry'. It involves questioning someone about their beliefs, and then testing those beliefs for consistency. The goal is to expose contradictions in the person's thinking, thereby demonstrating that they don't truly have knowledge about the subject they thought they did.\n\n*   **Human Wisdom:** Socrates does not claim to have *divine* knowledge, but he does allow for the possibility of *human* wisdom. According to the course materials, Socrates emphasizes that human wisdom is an awareness of how little one actually knows. It's a recognition of one's own fallibility.\n\n*   **Reconciliation through Fallibility:** The course material suggests that Socrates acknowledges that his inquiry is fallible, and that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.\n\n*   **The Role of the Elenchus in Acknowledging Fallibility:** Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\nIn essence, Socrates reconciles his disavowal of knowledge with his claim to human wisdom by:\n\n1.  **Acknowledging the Limits of Human Understanding:** He recognizes that humans are fallible and can never achieve certainty.\n2.  **Embracing the Elenchus as a Tool:** He uses the elenchus not to attain absolute knowledge, but to identify and eliminate false beliefs, and to promote consistency in one's beliefs.\n3.  **Defining Wisdom as Awareness of Ignorance:** He defines human wisdom as the awareness of one's own limitations and the recognition that one's beliefs may be flawed.\n\nI hope this explanation helps clarify the relationship between Socrates' disavowal of knowledge, his concept of human wisdom, and his use of the elenchus!

(As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1",
      "d) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one's desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, \"I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one's superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising...but on Socrates' view a person becomes good by virtue of having knowledge, moreover, knowledge is something one can never be deprived of once one has it. Beat me, rob me, etc., and my knowledge\nremains. If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then\nno one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks! Consider again the thesis that virtue is (moral) knowledge. It follows from this that one who lacks virtue, lacks moral knowledge, ie., is ignorant. But action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate. If doing harm is a failure of virtue, it must also be a failure of knowlege, and so be involuntary. (We will consider this in greater depth in connection with the Meno.)\n\nV.

Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission?

At 26a, Socrates says \"Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly....\" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (\"death is something I couldn't care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious\" (32d).)

      "24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocratic Definition and the Elenchus\n\nI. Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it",
      " piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the \"What is X?\" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to \"What is X?\" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X's, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor's virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: \"The Socratic Elenchus\"\n\n24.01 1",
      "3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-",
      "t is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2",
      "No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge. Although he thinks his beliefs are consistent, inconsistency is sometimes difficult to find; only diligent testing and retesting will establish their coherence. He differs from his interlocutors because he, unlike they, respect the difficulty of achieving consistency in one's beliefs. Perhaps the only thing he can say he knows with confidence is that he lacks the required assurances of consistency, and so lacks knowledge.\n\nSome may want to push this idea even further. The fact that a set of beliefs is consistent is no guarantee of their truth. As we saw above, one might gain consistency in a set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false.
