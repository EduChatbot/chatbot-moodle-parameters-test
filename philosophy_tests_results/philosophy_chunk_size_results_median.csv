"What does the term 'eudaimonia' mean in Aristotle’s philosophy, and what is its literal Greek breakdown?","['wever, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist.

[Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to ']","Okay, I can certainly help you understand Aristotle's three levels of potentiality and actuality with the example of someone speaking Greek.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **First Potentiality (1P):** This is the initial capacity to learn something. Think of a baby who has the potential to learn Greek. They aren't able to speak it yet, but they have the inherent capacity to learn it if they undergo the necessary development and education. The course material describes this as ""infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language)""

*   **Second Potentiality (2P) / First Actuality (1A):** This is the state of having learned something but not actively using it. Imagine someone who has learned Greek but is currently sitting quietly. They *can* speak Greek if prompted or if they choose to, but they aren't doing it at this moment. The potentiality to speak Greek has been actualized through learning, even though it's not being actively expressed. The course material describes this as ""quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to""

*   **Second Actuality (2A):** This is the state of actively using the knowledge or skill that one has. This is someone who is actually speaking Greek. They have the knowledge (2P/1A) and are actively using it. The course material describes this as ""person actually speaking Greek""

**In simpler terms:**

*   **1P:** The *potential* to learn.
*   **2P/1A:** The *ability* to do something, even if you're not doing it right now.
*   **2A:** The *active use* of that ability.

Aristotle uses these distinctions to explain how things develop and change. Matter has the potential to become something, and form is what makes that potential become actual.

I hope this explanation clarifies Aristotle's concepts of potentiality and actuality! Let me know if you have any further questions.
","The three levels are: (i) First potentiality (1P), where a human infant has the capacity to learn Greek; (ii) Second potentiality/first actuality (2P/1A), where a person has learned Greek and can speak it but is currently sitting quietly; and (iii) Second actuality (2A), which is the state of a person actually speaking Greek.",0.24206349205542327,1.0,1.0,0.8606332693080297,Chunk 512

Based on the course materials, here's a breakdown:

**The Articulation Condition:**

*   **Definition:** If a person S is knowledgeable about X, then S will be able to offer a Socratically-acceptable definition of X.
*   **In simpler terms:** If you truly *know* something, you should be able to clearly explain what it is.

**Why is this important to Socrates?**

*   **Virtue and Knowledge:** Socrates believed that virtue is a form of knowledge. Therefore, if someone possesses a virtue (like courage), they should be able to define it. For example, a truly courageous person should be able to explain what courage *is*.
*   **Testing Knowledge:** The articulation condition serves as a test for whether someone truly possesses knowledge. If they can't articulate a clear definition, then their claim to knowledge is questionable.

**Examples to illustrate the articulation condition:**

*   If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are.
*   If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is.
*   If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot.
*   If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot.
*   If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).

I hope this explanation helps clarify the articulation condition! Let me know if you have any further questions.

In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why w', 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentia', ' their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted', 'gs possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, i', 'is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University P', 'This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or', 'oul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison:', 'pable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea', 'ye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the sou', 'wise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, o']","Okay, let's break down Aristotle's comparisons of the axe and the eye to the soul.

*   **Axe Comparison:** The main point here is that the soul is like the *function* or *purpose* of an object, not just its physical shape. An axe isn't just a certain arrangement of wood and steel; it's that arrangement *organized to cut*. The ""soul"" of the axe is its ability to cut. If it loses that ability, it's no longer truly an axe, only in name. Similarly, the soul isn't some separate, invisible entity, but the *ability* of a living thing to perform its characteristic functions.
*   **Eye Comparison:** This comparison emphasizes that the soul is a kind of *ability* or *power*. The eye isn't just a shape; it's the shape *plus* the power of sight. Sight is the ability to see, and without that ability, it's not really an eye. Aristotle says that just as the pupil and the power of sight constitute the eye, the soul plus the body constitutes the animal. The ability to see isn't some mysterious being separate from the eye itself. Likewise, the soul isn't a separate entity, but the set of abilities that a living thing has.

In both cases, Aristotle is arguing against the idea that the soul is a separate entity that can exist independently of the body (as dualists believe). He's also offering an alternative to materialism, which might reduce living things to just their physical components. Instead, he's saying the soul is the *form* of a living thing, its organization and abilities to perform certain functions. It's what makes a living thing what it is.","The comparisons illustrate that the soul is a capacity or power, not a separate substance. For an axe, its 'soul' would be 'being an axe' (its ability to cut). For an eye, its 'soul' would be sight. In both cases, the soul is inseparable from the material body (the wood/steel or the eye-jelly) and if the capacity is lost, the object is only that thing in name only.",0.642757936499902,1.0,1.0,0.8666277862050125,Chunk 512

Here's a breakdown:

*   **The Soul as the Key to Happiness:** Socrates contrasts his view with the common belief that satisfying desires is the route to happiness. Instead, he argues that a well-cared-for soul is fundamental to true happiness.
*   **Injustice Harms the Soul:** Acting unjustly or doing wrong damages the soul. The course materials pose the question, ""How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?"" This suggests that Socrates sees the soul as something that can be injured or corrupted by immoral actions.
*   **Virtue and Moral Knowledge:** Socrates links virtue to moral knowledge. If virtue *is* knowledge, then acquiring moral knowledge through philosophical inquiry becomes ""morally therapeutic,"" benefiting the soul.
*   **The Unexamined Life:** This concept is directly tied to the care of the soul. Socrates believes that a life without philosophical examination and the pursuit of moral knowledge is not worth living. This is because, without examination, the soul cannot be properly cared for or achieve virtue.

In essence, Socrates sees the soul as the most important aspect of a person, and its well-being is directly linked to living a virtuous, examined life.

Cress.\n\n1 Roughly: Empirical knowledge: S knows p empirically ']","Okay, let's break down why Descartes considers dreaming a stronger reason for doubt than optical illusions in Meditation 1.

Here's a breakdown of Descartes' reasoning:

*   **The Problem with Senses:** Descartes aims to find a foundation for knowledge that is absolutely certain. He starts by examining knowledge gained through the senses.
*   **Limitations of the Senses:** He acknowledges that our senses can sometimes deceive us, like in the case of optical illusions. However, he initially suggests that we can only doubt beliefs about things that are ""very small or in the distance."" He admits that he can't doubt things that are right in front of him.
*   **Dreaming as a Deeper Doubt:** Descartes introduces the possibility of dreaming as a more profound challenge. He realizes that when we dream, we can have experiences that are incredibly vivid and indistinguishable from waking life. He says, ""...how often does my evening slumber persuade me of such ordinary things as these: that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace – when in fact I am lying undressed in bed!"" (60)
*   **No ""Sure Sign"":** Descartes' point is that there is no ""sure sign"" based on the qualitative experience of dreaming that you are awake and not dreaming.

**Why Dreaming is a Stronger Doubt**

In Aristotle's view:

*   **Instrumental Value:** Some things are valuable as tools to get something else. Their value lies in what they can *get* you. The text uses the example of money, which is often desired to acquire other things, like yachts. So, money has instrumental value because it *instruments* other ends.

*   **Final Value:** Other things are valuable in and of themselves. They aren't desired for the sake of something else, but are the ultimate goal. The text states that these ends ""don’t seem to be for the sake of other things. They are of final value.""

Aristotle argues that if everything only had instrumental value, then our desires would be ""empty and futile"" because there would be no ultimate goal to ground our actions.

Is there anything else I can help you understand about Aristotle's ideas?
","Ends of instrumental value are those pursued for the sake of other ends (for example, money is sought for the sake of buying things like yachts). Ends of final value are those that are not for the sake of other things but are desired for their own sake.

In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted', 's life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants an', 'gs possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, i', 'wise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, o', 'ut life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima.

Ie., our desires may be""]","Okay, let's break down Socrates' seemingly strange claim that ""no one can harm a good person,"" based on the course materials you've provided.

**The Core Idea**

Socrates doesn't mean that good people are immune to physical harm or insults. Instead, he's focused on what truly matters: the well-being of the soul. His argument hinges on these points:

1.  **The Soul is Primary:** Socrates believes the most important thing is the health and well-being of one's soul.
2.  **Virtue is Knowledge:** Socrates equates virtue with knowledge, particularly moral knowledge. If you know what's right, you'll do what's right.
3.  **Knowledge Cannot Be Taken Away:** Once someone possesses knowledge (especially moral knowledge), it's a permanent part of them. External forces can't steal it.
4.  **Harm and the Soul:** Because moral knowledge is essential for the soul's well-being, and this knowledge can't be taken away, no one can truly harm a good person in the way that really counts.

**Why Socrates Thinks This Way**

*   **Goodness Comes From Within:** Socrates sees goodness as an internal quality, rooted in knowledge and virtue. External actions by others can't corrupt this inner goodness.
*   **Focus on What Matters:** Even if someone is physically harmed, robbed, or insulted, Socrates would argue that these things are superficial compared to the state of one's soul. If a person retains their virtue and knowledge, they haven't suffered true harm.
*   **The Harm-Doer Harms Themselves:** Socrates also suggests that a person who does harm is actually worse off than the victim. This is because committing harmful acts damages the soul of the perpetrator.

**Important Considerations & Possible Objections**

*   **What about obvious harm?** The course material acknowledges the obvious objection: ""Obviously people harm good people all the time!"" Socrates' denial of this seems strange, but it's based on his view that a person becomes good by having knowledge, which can't be taken away.
*   **The Definition of Harm:** Socrates has a very specific definition of harm. He's not talking about physical or material harm, but rather harm to one's soul and moral character.
*   **The Role of Intent:** Socrates also believes that ""no one deliberately does harm [injustice]."" This is linked to his idea that wrongdoing stems from ignorance. If people truly knew what was right, they wouldn't choose to do wrong.

**In Summary**

Socrates' claim that ""no one can harm a good person"" is a philosophical statement about the nature of goodness, knowledge, and the soul. He believes that true harm is damage to one's soul, and that external actions can't take away the inner virtue and knowledge that define a good person.
","Socrates believes that a person becomes good through (moral) knowledge, which is something that cannot be taken away. Since the soul and its moral well-being are of primary importance for happiness, external harms (like being robbed or beaten) do not affect what truly counts. Thus, a worse person cannot harm a good person because they cannot strip them of their virtue or knowledge.",0.9444444444287038,1.0,1.0,0.9021284345128819,Chunk 512

Cress.\n\n1 Roughly: Empirical knowledge: S knows p empirically ']","Based on the text you provided, here's why Descartes introduces the idea of a malicious demon:

*   **To Extend the Scope of Doubt:** Descartes is undertaking a project of systematic doubt, questioning the foundations of all his beliefs to determine which, if any, are truly secure and indubitable. The dream argument casts doubt on sensory experiences, but Descartes wants to push the doubt even further.

*   **To Question Reasoning Itself:** The ""evil genius"" hypothesis takes the doubt to a deeper level than the dream argument. While dreaming primarily challenges the reliability of our senses, the malicious demon challenges the reliability of our reasoning powers themselves. If such a demon exists, it could be systematically deceiving us about everything, including logic and mathematics.

*   **To Find an Indubitable Foundation:** By considering even the most extreme possibilities for error, like the influence of a supremely powerful and clever evil genius, Descartes hopes to identify beliefs that remain certain even under such radical doubt. These beliefs could then serve as a solid foundation for knowledge.

In essence, the evil genius is a tool Descartes uses to test the limits of what can be doubted, in his quest to discover absolutely certain truths.
","Descartes introduces the 'evil genius'—a being supremely powerful and clever—to see if he can doubt not just the external world, but also his reasoning about 'very general things' like arithmetic and geometry. This hypothesis allows him to admit that even his most basic rational judgments could be 'bedeviling hoaxes' designed to deceive him.",0.18253968253055555,1.0,1.0,0.9027899291794883,Chunk 512

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentia', ' their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted', 'gs possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, i', 'he view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such ', 'bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it.

First c', 'is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University P', 'This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul.

From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, o']","Okay, I can certainly help you understand hylomorphism and how it relates to Aristotle's view of the soul, especially in contrast to Plato.

**Hylomorphism**

Based on the text, hylomorphism is a central concept in Aristotle's philosophy. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Form and Matter:** Instead of seeing two separate realms like Plato, Aristotle believed that ordinary things are made up of two aspects: form and matter.
*   **Form Enforms Matter:** Form doesn't exist independently; it only exists when it ""enforms"" matter. Think of it like this: you can't have the shape of a statue without the clay (matter) being shaped.
*   **Matter as Potential:** Matter is essentially the potential to be formed. It's the raw material that can become something specific.
*   **Essence:** Things are distinguished not by their matter (which may be the same), but by their form. Form determines what something *is* (a tree, a person, etc.).

**Aristotle's View of the Soul vs. Plato's**

Here's how hylomorphism shapes Aristotle's view of the soul and how it differs from Plato:

*   **Interdependence:** Aristotle saw the soul as the form of the body, and the body as the matter. They are interdependent, like wax and its shape. You can't have one without the other. This is a key difference from Plato, who believed the soul and body were separate and that the soul could exist independently.
*   **Soul as the Principle of Life:** For Aristotle, the soul (*psuchē*) is what gives life to a living thing. It's the *essence* of a living being.
*   **Rejection of Dualism and Materialism:** The text indicates that Aristotle rejects both dualism (the view that soul and body are completely separate) and materialism (the view that only matter exists). Hylomorphism offers a third way.
*   **Hierarchy of Souls:** Aristotle recognized different forms of life, each with different capacities. Plants have souls with the capacity for nutrition and reproduction. Animals have these capacities plus perception. Humans have all of these, plus the capacity for thinking or understanding.

**In Simple Terms**

Imagine an axe. Plato might say the ""idea"" of an axe exists in a separate realm, and the physical axe is just a poor copy. Aristotle would say the axe is a combination of matter (the metal and wood) and form (the axe-shape and its ability to chop). The ""soul"" of the axe, in a way, is its form – what makes it an axe and gives it the ability to perform its function.

**Key Differences Summarized**

| Feature          | Plato                                  | Aristotle (Hylomorphism)                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Reality          | Two separate realms (forms and matter) | Form and matter are interdependent aspects of things |
| Soul and Body    | Separate and independent               | Interdependent (soul is the form of the body) |
| Focus            | Abstract Forms                         | The natural world                             |

I hope this explanation clarifies hylomorphism and how it informs Aristotle's view of the soul in contrast to Plato's! Let me know if you have any further questions.
","Hylomorphism is the view that all ordinary things are a complex of form and matter. Aristotle identifies the body as matter (potentiality) and the soul as form (actuality). Unlike Plato's dualism, which sees the soul and body as independent and separable entities, Aristotle's hylomorphism views them as interdependent aspects of a single individual, like the wax and its shape.",0.642757936499902,1.0,1.0,0.9300672351100164,Chunk 512

*   **In simpler terms:** People don't knowingly want what is bad for them. If they do something harmful, it's because they are doing it without realizing it is bad for them.

*   **In simpler terms:** Being virtuous means having moral knowledge. People who do immoral things do so because they lack the knowledge of what is right. Their bad actions are unintentional, stemming from a lack of understanding.

In essence, both paradoxes suggest that people never intentionally choose what is bad for them (Prudential) or what is morally wrong (Moral). Wrongdoing arises from a lack of knowledge or understanding.","The Prudential Paradox states that no one desires what is harmful for themselves, and those who pursue harm do so involuntarily.

The Socratic Elenchus is a method used to examine someone's beliefs with the goal of determining truths about how one ought to live and to test if someone is living a moral life. So, it's both a philosophical and therapeutic tool.

Here's the standard pattern broken down into steps:

1.  **Interlocutor asserts a thesis (P):** Someone, the person being questioned (the interlocutor), states a belief or claim (P) that Socrates thinks is wrong and wants to disprove.
2.  **Socrates secures agreement to further premises (Q, R, etc.):** Socrates gets the interlocutor to agree to some additional statements or premises (Q, R, and so on). Importantly, these premises are usually accepted without a lot of debate.
3.  **Socrates argues that Q and R entail not-P:** Socrates then demonstrates, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R (the agreed-upon premises) logically lead to the opposite of P (not-P).
4.  **Socrates claims P has been shown to be false, and not-P is true:** Finally, Socrates concludes that the original thesis (P) has been proven false, and its opposite (not-P) is true.

**Example:**

The text uses an example from Euthyphro to illustrate this pattern:

*   **Question:** What is piety and impiety, both with regards to murder and other things?
*   **Target thesis (P):** ""The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious.""
*   **Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon (Q):** The pious itself is the same as all pious actions.
*   **Socrates argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.**
*   **Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.**

In simpler terms, Socrates takes a statement, finds other beliefs that the person holds, and then shows how those beliefs contradict the original statement.

Let me know if you would like a more detailed explanation of any of these steps or the example!
",The standard pattern involves four steps: (1) The interlocutor asserts a target thesis P; (2) Socrates secures agreement to further premises Q and R; (3) Socrates argues that Q and R entail not-P; (4) Socrates claims that P has been shown false (or inconsistent) and not-P is true.,0.5333333333155555,1.0,1.0,0.8388760531507012,Chunk 512

In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age', 'll harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man).

In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc', 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ', 't the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', 'r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB.

Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important', ' to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue.

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc', "" my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI.

There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, others who know that the bad things harm them. And do you think that those who believe that bad things benefit them know that they are bad? No, that I cannot altogether believe. It is clear then that those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad. It follows that those who have no knowledge of these things and believe them to be good clearly desire good things.

To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n1"", ""akness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desi"", ""no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what's the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be over"", 'cons, we finally come to a judgment about what\'s the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: ""it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good."" But once we\'ve modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one\'s power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act', ""\n\nDivide and Conquer? So far we have not distinguished different ways that something can be bad. On one hand things which\nare harmful, or against our self-interest are bad for us; on the other hand things may be judged morally\ngood or bad. If we are sensitive to this distinction we may see that the argument can be divided into two different conclusions:\n\nIf I judge that an action is best for me, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it. If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value. Ie., our desires may be responsive to other concerns besides moral value. B""]","Socrates addresses this apparent contradiction—the idea that someone might desire something bad—in the Meno. He distinguishes between:

*   **a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad.**
*   **b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.**

Socrates argues that if someone desires something bad without realizing it's bad, then they actually desire something they *believe* to be good, even if it's objectively bad.

In other words, Socrates believes that people always desire what they perceive to be good. If they choose something that turns out to be bad, it's because they were mistaken about its true nature or consequences. They were aiming for something good but missed the mark due to a lack of knowledge or understanding.","Socrates argues that those who do not know things to be bad do not actually desire the bad things themselves; rather, they desire things they believe to be good, even if those things are actually bad in reality.

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ', 't the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se', 'ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A', 'evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .', 'otential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

Or maybe:\n\n.']","Okay, I can definitely clarify Aristotle's three levels of potentiality and actuality, using the example of speaking Greek:

Aristotle uses the example of someone speaking Greek to illustrate how a capacity can exist at different levels of development or realization. Here's a breakdown:

*   **i. First Potentiality (1P):** Think of an infant. An infant has the *potential* to learn Greek. They aren't able to speak it *now*, but they have the innate capacity to develop that ability if they are exposed to the language and undergo the learning process. So, at this stage, the infant *can* speak Greek, but only in the sense that they *could* develop the ability to do so. We can say that something at the 1P stage has a capacity *for* a capacity.

*   **ii. Second Potentiality (2P) / First Actuality (1A):** Now imagine someone who has learned Greek but is currently sitting quietly. They *know* Greek. They aren't speaking it at this moment, but they *can* speak it if they choose to or if someone prompts them. They've actualized the *potential* to speak Greek (they've learned the language), so they are at the stage of first actuality. But they still have the *potential* to actually speak, so they are also at the stage of second potentiality. The first potentiality (the infant's potential to learn) has been actualized, even though the speaker isn’t actually speaking.

*   **iii. Second Actuality (2A):** This is when the person is *actually* speaking Greek. They are actively *exercising* their ability. This is the full realization of the potential to speak Greek.

**In summary:**

*   **1P:** Capacity for a capacity (infant's potential to learn)
*   **2P/1A:** Having the capacity (knowing the language but not speaking)
*   **2A:** Exercising the capacity (actually speaking the language)

Does that explanation help clarify the three levels?
","The three levels are: (i) First potentiality (1P), where a human infant has the capacity to learn Greek; (ii) Second potentiality/first actuality (2P/1A), where a person has learned Greek and can speak it but is currently sitting quietly; and (iii) Second actuality (2A), which is the state of a person actually speaking Greek.",0.22619047617916663,1.0,0.9565217391304348,0.8824662199642023,Chunk 1000

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.

How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Demolishing to Rebuild:** Descartes compares his approach to demolishing a house with unstable foundations or a barrel of apples with some rotten ones. To ensure a stable structure or prevent further decay, he believes it's necessary to tear down the existing structure (his existing beliefs) and rebuild from the ground up with secure foundations.

*   **Doubting to Discover Trustworthiness:** Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations.

*   **Focusing on Foundations:** He won't examine every belief individually, as that would be an endless task. Instead, he aims to undermine the foundational principles upon which his beliefs are based. If the foundations are shaky, everything built upon them will crumble.

In essence, Descartes uses systematic doubt as a tool to identify and eliminate unreliable beliefs, paving the way for establishing knowledge based on solid, unquestionable foundations.","Descartes believes that to establish anything 'firm and lasting in the sciences,' he must 'raze everything to the ground' and investigate his beliefs at their foundations.

There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato).

The answer to ""What is X?"" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X\'s, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to disco', 'es, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor\'s virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: ""The Socratic Elenchus""\n\n24.01 1', ""No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge."", ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"", '.

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ', 't the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', 'r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First compa', 'ally within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1', 'This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an ani', 'ious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se', 'human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ']","The axe and eye comparisons are used to illustrate Aristotle's concept of the soul as a specific kind of ability or function, not a separate, independent entity.

*   **Axe:** The essence of an axe is its ability to cut wood. Its form is not just its shape, but its shape organized to perform this function. If it loses the ability to cut, it's no longer truly an axe, only in name.
*   **Eye:** Similarly, the essence of an eye is sight, the ability to see. Without sight, it's not really an eye, just a physical object resembling one.

In both cases, the ability or function (cutting, seeing) is not a mysterious, separate entity but is intrinsically linked to the physical structure (axe, eye). This mirrors Aristotle's view of the soul as the form of a living body, inseparable from it, and responsible for its functions and capacities.
","The comparisons illustrate that the soul is a capacity or power, not a separate substance. For an axe, its 'soul' would be 'being an axe' (its ability to cut). For an eye, its 'soul' would be sight. In both cases, the soul is inseparable from the material body (the wood/steel or the eye-jelly) and if the capacity is lost, the object is only that thing in name only.",0.5709183673387828,1.0,1.0,0.8719077737707547,Chunk 1000

[‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections an', 's to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) Descartes won’t be able to inspect every belief, of course. How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless. Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII. Perception and Illusion Hypothesis: THE SENSES ARE A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nA.

Sometimes individuals hallucinate. • Note that in such cases there is no external interference, but there is an internal interference in one’s perceptual processes. So we need to rule out both to have secure foundations. • Descartes refuses to consider the possibility that he is insane: “But such people are mad, and I would appear no less mad, were I to take their behavior as an example for myself.” (60).\n\nSo we should adjust the principle:\n\nDescartes, René.

We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances, and competent from incompetent perceivers; and if circumstances are favorable and the perceiver is competent, then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: Even competent perceivers sometimes have vivid dreams. And “there are no definitve signs by which to distinguish being awake from being asleep” (60).\n\nHow often does my evening slumber persuade me of such ordinary things as these: that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace – when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! (60)\n\nDescartes’ point is that there is no “sure sign” based on the qualitative experience of dreaming that I am awake and not dreaming. • You might protest: Of course I can tell the difference between dreams and waking experience!

What is needed is a sure sign, i.e., a sign that will\nalways be there to tell you are dreaming when you are.\n\nIV. Knowledge of A Priori Truth1 Perhaps we cannot find a sure foundation for perceptual knowledge, but there are other sorts of knowledge, e.g., knowledge of very general things (e.g. , that objects have color, shape, quantity, and so forth) and of things derived from this (e.g. , arithmetic, geometry).

It seems so, for the naïf concludes:\n\nBut eventually I am forced to admit that there is nothing among the things I once believed to be true which it is not permissible to doubt – and not out of frivolity or lack of forethought, but for valid and considered reasons.

In the case of dreaming, we continue to assume that the agent’s reasoning powers are intact. But what about the malicious demon? Does the malicious demon also call into question our reasoning powers? If so, then how can we carry on in rational inquiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream. Is entitled to infer that therefore all experience may be a dream? Consider a fair lottery. Any number has the same chance of winning as any other number. It is true that anyone can win the lottery.

A priori knowledge: S knows p a priori iff S’s reasons in support of p do not rest on sense experience.\n\nHaslanger 2']","Okay, I can help you understand why Descartes considers dreaming a stronger reason for doubt than optical illusions in Meditation 1.

Here's the breakdown based on the provided text:

*   **Optical Illusions as a Source of Doubt:** Descartes acknowledges that our senses can deceive us, citing optical illusions as an example (e.g., a stick appearing bent in water). This leads him to question the reliability of the senses as a source of knowledge.

*   **The Dream Argument:** Descartes introduces the possibility that he might be dreaming. He points out that during sleep, he often has experiences indistinguishable from waking life (e.g., ""that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace""). He argues that there are no definitive signs to distinguish being awake from being asleep.

*   **Why Dreaming is a Stronger Doubt:** The key reason dreaming provides a *stronger* reason for doubt is that it undermines the very foundation of our perceptual experience *as a whole*.

    *   Optical illusions are typically localized and can be corrected with further investigation or understanding of the circumstances. We can usually identify the illusion and understand why our senses were misled.
    *   Dreaming, however, casts doubt on *all* sensory experiences. If any experience could be a dream, then we can't be certain that *any* of our perceptions accurately reflect reality. Descartes is looking for a ""sure sign"" to distinguish dreaming from waking, and he can't find one. The issue isn't just that our senses are *sometimes* wrong (as with illusions), but that they could *always* be wrong.

In essence, optical illusions are like isolated errors in our perception, while the dream argument suggests a global uncertainty about the validity of all our sensory experiences. This is why Descartes sees dreaming as a more profound and unsettling source of doubt in his quest to find a solid foundation for knowledge.
","Optical illusions are 'external interference' that occur in unfavorable circumstances (like a stick looking bent in water). However, the 'dream argument' suggests that there are no 'definitive signs' to distinguish being awake from being asleep. This means that even when circumstances seem favorable and the perceiver seems competent, they could still be mistaken, undermining the reliability of the senses entirely.",0.3381944444359896,0.6666666666666666,0.8181818181818182,0.9587735086369409,Chunk 1000

Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter.

In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with.

They are of final value. iv.

The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action.

[Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

Here's the breakdown of instrumental and final value:

*   **Instrumental Value:** These are the ends or goods that we desire for the sake of something else. Their value lies in their usefulness as a means to achieve another end. For example, money is typically of instrumental value because we want it to buy things like yachts or other goods and experiences.
*   **Final Value:** These are the ends or goods that we desire for their own sake. They are not sought as a means to something else, but are valuable in themselves. Aristotle argues that if there were no final values, our desires would be ""empty and futile"" because everything would be done for the sake of something else, leading to an infinite and ultimately meaningless chain of desires.

In simpler terms, instrumental values are tools to get something else, while final values are the ultimate goals themselves.

In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se', 'ver, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A', 'evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . .', 'otential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ', ' to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue.

A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4.

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue.

For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot', 't is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work?

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency.

But once we\'ve modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one\'s power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an act', ""\n\nDivide and Conquer?

If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value.

*   **Knowledge is Permanent:** Once someone has knowledge, it can't be taken away, even by force or other means.
*   **The Soul's Well-being:** Socrates emphasizes that the soul is the most important part of a person, and moral knowledge is what makes the soul healthy and happy.
*   **True Harm:** According to Socrates, the only real harm is that which affects the soul. Since knowledge can't be taken away and is essential for the soul's well-being, no one can truly harm a good (knowledgeable) person in a way that matters.

In essence, external things like physical harm or material loss don't truly harm a good person because their soul, which is the most important thing, remains untouched and virtuous through their knowledge.","Socrates believes that a person becomes good through (moral) knowledge, which is something that cannot be taken away.

It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno.

How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless.

Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Building on Previous Doubt:** Descartes starts by questioning the reliability of the senses, noting they sometimes deceive us (like optical illusions). He then extends this doubt to the possibility that he might be dreaming, which could mean that his sensory experiences don't reflect reality.

*   **Challenging Reasoning Itself:** The evil genius hypothesis takes the doubt a step further. It suggests that there might be a supremely powerful and clever being whose sole purpose is to deceive Descartes about everything, including things that seem most certain, such as mathematical truths or logical principles.

*   **Undermining Foundations of Knowledge:** Descartes believes that to establish firm and lasting knowledge, he needs to examine the foundations upon which his beliefs are built. If those foundations can be shaken, then everything built upon them becomes uncertain. The evil genius is a tool to attack the very foundations of his knowledge by questioning the reliability of his reasoning powers.

*   **Seeking Absolute Certainty:** By imagining the most radical scenario for doubt, Descartes hopes to find something that even an evil genius could not undermine. If he can discover a belief that is immune to even this extreme form of deception, then he can be certain of its truth. This is the starting point for rebuilding his system of knowledge on a solid foundation.

In essence, the evil genius is a philosophical device that Descartes uses to explore the limits of skepticism and to search for an unshakable foundation for knowledge.
","Descartes introduces the 'evil genius'—a being supremely powerful and clever—to see if he can doubt not just the external world, but also his reasoning about 'very general things' like arithmetic and geometry. This hypothesis allows him to admit that even his most basic rational judgments could be 'bedeviling hoaxes' designed to deceive him.",0.17361111110243055,1.0,1.0,0.8329200402574543,Chunk 1000

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural ', 't the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.', 'r some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB.

First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, or generally the matter of a thing and that of which it is the\nmatter (412b7-8)\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1', 'This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an ani', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two se', 'human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ']","Okay, I can certainly help you understand hylomorphism and how it relates to Aristotle's view of the soul, especially in contrast to Plato.

**What is Hylomorphism?**

Hylomorphism is a philosophical theory developed by Aristotle that explains reality in terms of two fundamental principles: matter and form. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Matter:** Matter is the ""stuff"" of which a thing is made. It's potentiality, meaning it has the potential to become something. Think of it as raw material.
*   **Form:** Form is what gives a thing its structure, organization, and essence. It's what makes a thing what it is, defining its actuality. Form ""enforms"" matter, shaping it into a specific thing.

Aristotle uses the example of a statue to illustrate this: The wood is the matter (potential statue), and the shape is the form (which makes it an actual statue). The statue itself is the matter/form complex, the individual thing.

**Aristotle's View of the Soul (psuchē) in Relation to Hylomorphism**

Aristotle applies hylomorphism to living things, including humans, to explain the nature of the soul:

*   **Soul as Form, Body as Matter:** For living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form. The soul is the ""form of a natural body having life potentially within it."" In other words, the soul is what organizes the body and gives it the capacity to live, grow, perceive, and think (depending on the kind of living thing).
*   **Interdependence:** Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed that the soul and body are interdependent. You wouldn't have one without the other. The soul needs the body to exist and carry out its functions, and the body needs the soul to be alive and organized.
*   **Soul as Ability:** The soul is a certain kind of ability. To be an axe is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue) but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. Likewise for the soul.
*As the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the animal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)

**How Aristotle's View Differs from Plato's**

The key difference lies in their understanding of the relationship between the soul and the body:

*   **Plato's Dualism:** Plato, as presented in the *Phaedo*, held a dualistic view. He believed that the soul and body are radically different and separable. The soul is immaterial and can exist independently of the body. In fact, Plato thought the soul was imprisoned in the body and longed to be free.
*   **Aristotle's Rejection of Dualism:** Aristotle rejected this dualism. He argued that the soul is not a separate substance but rather the form or organization of the body. The soul cannot exist without the body, just as the form of a statue cannot exist without the matter (e.g., wood or bronze).

**In Summary**

Hylomorphism is the foundation for Aristotle's understanding of the soul. He sees the soul as the form of a living body, inseparable from it and responsible for its life functions. This contrasts sharply with Plato's dualistic view of the soul as a separate, immaterial entity.

I hope this explanation clarifies the concept of hylomorphism and its significance in understanding Aristotle's view of the soul! Let me know if you have any further questions.
","Hylomorphism is the view that all ordinary things are a complex of form and matter. Aristotle identifies the body as matter (potentiality) and the soul as form (actuality). Unlike Plato's dualism, which sees the soul and body as independent and separable entities, Aristotle's hylomorphism views them as interdependent aspects of a single individual, like the wax and its shape.",0.6202947845716374,0.75,1.0,0.9019833264146663,Chunk 1000

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions.

(5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R).

In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis.

This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge.

But once we\'ve modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible.

If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value.

Let's break down the Prudential and Moral Paradoxes as they relate to Socrates' views on action, based on the information you've provided.

**Prudential Paradox:**

*   **Core Idea:** This paradox centers on the idea that people don't knowingly desire what is bad or harmful *for themselves*. If someone pursues something bad or harmful, it must be involuntary.
*   **In simpler terms:** We always aim for what we *think* is good for us. If we end up doing something that hurts us, it's because we were mistaken about what was truly good for us.
*   **Example:** Imagine someone who overeats despite knowing it's unhealthy. According to the prudential paradox, they don't *really* desire the harm; they are either misinformed about the extent of the harm or are prioritizing some other perceived benefit (like the immediate pleasure of eating) over their long-term health.

**Moral Paradox:**

*   **Core Idea:** This paradox links virtue with knowledge. To be virtuous, one must possess moral knowledge. Consequently, immoral actions are always involuntary, stemming from ignorance.
*   **In simpler terms:** People act wrongly because they don't *know* what is right. If they had true moral knowledge, they would always act virtuously.
*   **Example:** Someone who steals might do so because they don't fully grasp the moral implications of theft or because they lack a true understanding of justice and fairness. If they *really* understood that stealing harms their own soul and the community, they wouldn't do it.

**Connection & Significance:**

*   Both paradoxes highlight Socrates' emphasis on the role of knowledge in guiding human action. He believed that people fundamentally desire what is good (whether for themselves or morally), and any deviation from this path is due to a lack of understanding or awareness.
*   The text suggests that the prudential paradox remains even if we accept that people act on their desires and don't desire what they *judge* to be bad for them.
*   The text also raises the question of whether we should take the moral paradox seriously, particularly if we assume that doing the right thing is actually in our self-interest.

I hope this explanation clarifies the two paradoxes for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or would like me to elaborate on any of these points!
","The Prudential Paradox states that no one desires what is harmful for themselves, and those who pursue harm do so involuntarily. The Moral Paradox states that virtue is moral knowledge, and therefore all those who act immorally or do wrong do so involuntarily out of ignorance.",0.09999999999,1.0,0.9130434782608695,0.9056899026941965,Chunk 1000
Aristotle lists 'self-sufficiency' as a requirement for the supreme good. How does he define a 'self-sufficient' life?,"['t the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another.', 'Aristotle on Happiness Nichomachean Ethics, Book I\n\n1. Goods and ends: some structural features (Bk I, Chs 1-2)\n\nThe overarching aim of the Nichomachean Ethics is to inquire into what makes for a good human life.\n\nIf… there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good. (1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .', 'be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good. (1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .\nii. Some of the ends (e.g., money) are for the sake of other ends (e.g., yachts). They are of instrumental value. iii. Other ends don’t seem to be for the sake of other things. They are of final value. iv. If there are no things of final value, the considerations motivating our choices “will go on without limit, so that desire will prove to be empty and futile” (1094a20–21). • Note: this observation alone doesn’t establish that there is only one final good. iv. The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given cert', '-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good. The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (a', 'ny of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good. The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (all) humans. • Why assume that the supreme good is the same for all of us? Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important', ""d of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important features that seem to make it uniquely suited to be the supreme good. It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good. Everyone may agree on this,\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press. All rights\n\n1 Note that it is controversial whether the supreme good must be d"", 'but disagree about what happiness amounts to. Will it be a life in which one experiences lots of pleasure, has lots of money, garners lots of praise or honor, or what. Aristotle wants to know, what are the constituents of a happy life? (1097b22–24) What does it take to be happy, truly happy? Can we characterize the life of complete human flourishing? What would such a life include? He is going to argue for what may seem a surprising conclusion: the perfect human life is one which consists in activity in accordance with virtue, i.e., human excellence; this is the life of human flourishing.\n\n3. The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7) Note that the the word translated as ‘function’ is ‘ergon .', 'human activity that makes us who we are?\n\nii. The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4). Conclusion: “the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational ', ' to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue. In what follows, Aristotle delves into virtue—what it is and how we get it.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

What is the', '24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocratic Definition and the Elenchus\n\nI. Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot', 'ledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

(6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the ""What is X?"" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to ""What is X?"" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X\'s, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to disco', 'es, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor\'s virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: ""The Socratic Elenchus""\n\n24.01 1', '3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R).

One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Qu"", 't is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Soc', ""No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge."", ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3""]","Okay, let's break down the standard pattern of Socratic Elenchus. Based on the course material you've provided, here's how it works:

**The Socratic Elenchus: A Step-by-Step Refutation**

The Socratic Elenchus is a method Socrates uses to examine someone's moral beliefs, with the aim of discovering truths and testing if the person is living a moral life. It's both a philosophical and therapeutic tool. Here's the procedure:

1.  **Initial Assertion (P):** The person Socrates is questioning (the interlocutor) states a thesis or belief (P) that Socrates thinks is wrong and wants to disprove.
2.  **Agreement on Further Premises (Q, R, etc.):** Socrates gets the interlocutor to agree to some additional statements or premises (Q, R, and so on). Importantly, these premises are usually *not* argued for at this point; they are simply accepted by the interlocutor.
3.  **Entailment of the Opposite (Not-P):** Socrates then argues that those agreed-upon premises (Q and R) logically lead to the opposite of the original thesis (Not-P). In other words, Socrates tries to show that if Q and R are true, then P must be false.
4.  **Claim of Refutation:** Socrates concludes that the original thesis (P) has been proven false, and its opposite (Not-P) is true.

**Example from the Euthyphro Dialogue**

Let's use the example from the Euthyphro dialogue to illustrate:

*   **Question:** What is piety and impiety?
*   **Target thesis (P):** ""The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious."" (Euthyphro believes piety is prosecuting his father for wrongdoing).
*   **Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon:**
    *   **(Q):** ""The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action."" (Piety has a common characteristic).
    *   **(R):** ""There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer."" (Prosecuting wrongdoers isn't the *only* pious action).
*   **Therefore, (not-P):** ""Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting is not common to all pious actions).""

**In essence, Socrates aims to show that Euthyphro's definition of piety conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds.** You can't consistently say that piety is a single action (prosecuting wrongdoers), while also agreeing that piety has a common characteristic across *all* pious actions and that there are other pious actions besides just prosecuting wrongdoers.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Inconsistency:** The core of the elenchus is exposing inconsistency in the interlocutor's beliefs.
*   **Fallibility:** The text emphasizes that this method doesn't guarantee absolute certainty. It's possible to reject a true belief during the process. Socrates acknowledges the fallibility of human knowledge.
*   **Socrates' Disavowal of Knowledge:** Socrates often claims to not have knowledge himself. This might be because he recognizes that his own beliefs are also subject to this process of elenctic inquiry and potential inconsistency.
*   **Purpose:** The Socratic Elenchus is meant to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life.

I hope this explanation clarifies the standard pattern of the Socratic Elenchus! Let me know if you have any further questions.
",The standard pattern involves four steps: (1) The interlocutor asserts a target thesis P; (2) Socrates secures agreement to further premises Q and R; (3) Socrates argues that Q and R entail not-P; (4) Socrates claims that P has been shown false (or inconsistent) and not-P is true.,0.32063492062423277,1.0,1.0,0.826120677009528,Chunk 1000
"What does the term 'eudaimonia' mean in Aristotle’s philosophy, and what is its literal Greek breakdown?","['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', 'ologia’ which means defense.

It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?).

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).)

Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5.

What is Socrates interested in finding something ""the same and alike"" in every pious action? Do you think there is something ""the same and alike"" in every pious (or just or courageous) action?\n\n4. Do Socrates and Euthyphro reach any conclusions about piety?

The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious.

Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2"", ""24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocrates on Weakness of Will\n\nOne of Socrates' most puzzling views is the claim that akrasia, or weakness of will, is impossible. We seem to encounter weakness of will on a daily basis. What is weakness of will? Standardly, cases of weakness of will are characterized as those in which one knows or believes that a certain action is better than another, but voluntarily does the worse action instead.\n\nThere seem to be many ways this can occur. For example, in spite of my judgment that it is best not to have a cigarette with my morning coffee, I may nevertheless go ahead and indulge, while continuing to think that the best thing for me to do would be to forego it. Or, in spite of my judgment that it would be far better for me to give my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, o"", 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on', "" was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good. The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (all) humans. • Why assume that the supreme good is the same for all of us? Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important features that seem to make it uniquely suited to be the supreme good. It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good.

In essence, *eudaimonia* is more than just a feeling of happiness; it's about living a flourishing and fulfilling life, guided by a sense of well-being and perhaps even a connection to something greater than oneself.","The term 'eudaimonia' is usually translated as 'happiness' but can also be translated as 'flourishing.'

Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) ', 'd of things derived from this (e.g. , arithmetic, geometry).

I will regard the heavens, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds, and all external things as nothing but the\nbedeviling hoaxes of my dreams, with which he lays snares for my credulity. (62-3)\n\nCould a malicious demon not only undermine our confidence in experience of the external world, but also confidence in our reasoning about general things? It seems so, for the naïf concludes:\n\nBut eventually I am forced to admit that there is nothing among the things I once believed to be true which it is not permissible to doubt – and not out of frivolity or lack of forethought, but for valid and considered reasons. (62)\n\nQuestions: 1. Note that Descartes dismisses madness as a source of error and replaces it with dreaming. Why? One possibility is that the insane are not only confused about their experiences, but have defective reasoning powers. In the case of dreaming, we continue to assume that the agent’s reasoning powers are intact. But what about the malicious demon? Does the malicious demon also call into question our reasoning powers? If so, then how can we carry on in rational inquiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream.

"Aristotle describes a 'Function Argument' in Book I, Chapter 7 of the Nichomachean Ethics. What are the three specific stages of this argument?","['ologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1', 'd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods.

Here's a breakdown:

**The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7)**

The word 'function' translates ‘ergon,’ which could also mean 'work,' 'business,' 'proper work,' or 'characteristic activity.'

The Function Argument unfolds in three stages:

*   **i. The existence of a human function**

    *   Aristotle starts by suggesting that various people and things have functions or characteristic activities.
    *   He gives examples such as craftspeople (artists, carpenters, leatherworkers) and body parts (eyes, hands, feet).
    *   He then poses the question of whether human beings have a function at all, or if we are ""naturally functionless.""
    *   The key question here is: What is the characteristic human activity that defines us?

*   **ii. The nature of the human function**

    *   Assuming that humans *do* have a function, Aristotle explores what that function might be.
    *   He considers various activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from *De Anima*.
    *   He rules out some activities because they aren't unique to humans, such as:

        *   Living (shared by all living things)
        *   Nutrition and growth (shared with plants)
        *   A life of sense perception (shared with animals)
    *   Aristotle is looking for ""the special function of a human being"".
    *   What remains, according to Aristotle, is ""an active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle"".
    *   Therefore, he concludes that ""the function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with, or not without, rational principle"".

*   **iii. The link between the human function and happiness**

    *   Given that the human function is ""activity of the soul in accord with reason,"" Aristotle connects this to the human good (happiness or *eudaimonia*).
    *   The connection is made through the idea of performing one's function *well*.
    *   Virtues are the capacities that enable things to perform their function well. For example:
        *   A paring knife functions to cut; its virtues are sharpness and ease of handling.
        *   A doctor functions to heal; their virtues include knowledge, skill, and a good bedside manner.
    *   Therefore, human virtues are the capacities that enable humans to perform *their* function well.
    *   Since the human function involves reason, excellent humans are those who live a life of activity of the soul in accordance with virtue/excellence.
    *   Aristotle concludes that ""the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.”

In essence, Aristotle argues that our unique capacity for rational thought and action is our defining function, and living in accordance with virtue (excellence in reasoning) is the key to human flourishing and happiness.","The three stages of the Function Argument are: (i) the existence of a human function, (ii) the nature of the human function, and (iii) the link between the human function and happiness.",0.162499999991875,1.0,1.0,0.889084928437989,Chunk 2000
How does Socrates explain why someone might appear to desire something 'bad'?,"['d) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living""(38a)? How are they connected? What\'s wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5. What reasons does Socrates give in the Crito for disregarding the views of the majority? Compare his views on this with the views of a cultural or moral relativist.\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Euthyphro:\n\n1. At 5d, Socrates asks Euthyphro ""What is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer: ""...to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...""?\n\n2. Socrates continues to press the question ""what is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer at 7a1: ""What is dear to the gods is pious....""?\n\n3. What is Socrates interested in finding something ""the same and alike"" in every pious action? Do you think there is something ""the same and alike"" in every pious (or just or courageous) action?\n\n4. Do Socrates and Euthyphro reach any conclusions about piety? If so, what are the conclusions? Do they agree on a definition of piety?\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n2', ' piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the ""What is X?"" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to ""What is X?"" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X\'s, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor\'s virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: ""The Socratic Elenchus""\n\n24.01 1', ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"", ""24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocrates on Weakness of Will\n\nOne of Socrates' most puzzling views is the claim that akrasia, or weakness of will, is impossible. We seem to encounter weakness of will on a daily basis. What is weakness of will? Standardly, cases of weakness of will are characterized as those in which one knows or believes that a certain action is better than another, but voluntarily does the worse action instead.\n\nThere seem to be many ways this can occur. For example, in spite of my judgment that it is best not to have a cigarette with my morning coffee, I may nevertheless go ahead and indulge, while continuing to think that the best thing for me to do would be to forego it. Or, in spite of my judgment that it would be far better for me to give my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, o"", ""the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, others who know that the bad things harm them. And do you think that those who believe that bad things benefit them know that they are bad? No, that I cannot altogether believe. It is clear then that those who do not know things to be bad do not desire what is bad, but they desire those things that they believe to be good but that are in fact bad. It follows that those who have no knowledge of these things and believe them to be good clearly desire good things. Is that not\nso? --It is likely.\n--Plato, Meno 77b2-e4\n\nAlthough Socrates' view that weakness of will is impossible conflicts with our ordinary experience of life, his view seems to rest on very plausible assumptions. To see his point, it is important to consider more\nclosely the relationship between desire and action. In the Meno (77c-78b), (and elsewhere), Socrates argues\nfor the claim that:\n\nNo one desires bad things; all people desire good things.\n\nOn the face of it, this appears to commit Socrates to the claim that:\n\n1) If an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if an action is good,\nthen one will desire to do it.\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n1"", ""We can then add a further premise to connect this to action:\n\n2) If I desire to perform or avoid an action, and it is in my power to do so, then I will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3) If an action is good, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it; and if an action is bad, and it is in my power to avoid it, then I will avoid it.\n\nBut if these conclusions are correct, then if an action is bad, and I perform it anyway, it must not have been in my power to avoid it, i.e., I must have done it involuntarily. So bad action is never voluntary.\n\nThis argument lacks plausibility as it stands because the premise from the Meno Socrates relies on (i.e., (1) above) isn’t obviously true. Moreover, (3) seems to be a much stronger conclusion than the thesis that weakness of will is impossible: the argument leads to the conclusion that no wrong action is voluntary, but this goes beyond saying that action I believe to be wrong is involuntary. Perhaps we should look for a different version of the argument that points to the latter rather than the former conclusion.\n\nII. The Meno argument: second thoughts\n\nTo start, let's consider the argument (1-3) as it stands. Should we accept the conclusion that no one\ndesires bad things, and everyone desires good things? It would seem not. For example, suppose that I desire to eat a mushroom quiche I made from some mushrooms I found on a walk in the woods. Unbeknownst to me, the mushrooms are poisonous. Eating the quiche would be a bad thing, yet it is something I desire. Socrates considers this objection in the Meno. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one's desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will d"", 'no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one\'s desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what\'s the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: ""it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good."" But once we\'ve modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one\'s power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an action is good, and it is in one\'s power to perform it, then one will perform it;\nand if one believes that the action is bad, and it is in one\'s power to avoid it, then one will avoid it.\n\n2', ""This argument is more plausible than our initial (1)-(3) and doesn’t entail that wrongdoing is always\ninvoluntary. But this argument still yields a conclusion which denies weakness of will, which is also problematic. What are we to do? All of the premises seem plausible, but they are inconsistent with the common sense claim that:\n\nSometimes I judge an action to be overall best, and nevertheless fail to perform it.\n\nIII. Possible responses:\n\n• As a matter of fact, weakness of will is impossible. Ordinary cases are not what they may seem, i.e.,\n(3*) is unproblematic.\n• The premise that we always desire what we judge best is false; judgment and desire is not linked in\nthis way, i.e., (1*) is false.\n•\nThe premise that we always act on our desires (where possible) is false, i.e., (2*) is false.\n\nDivide and Conquer? So far we have not distinguished different ways that something can be bad. On one hand things which\nare harmful, or against our self-interest are bad for us; on the other hand things may be judged morally\ngood or bad. If we are sensitive to this distinction we may see that the argument can be divided into two different conclusions:\n\nIf I judge that an action is best for me, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it. If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value. Ie., our desires may be responsive to other concerns besides moral value. But this in fact suggests that there are two paradoxical ideas at stake:\n\nPrudential paradox:\n\nNo one desires what's bad or harmful (for oneself). All those who pursue what's bad or harmful (for themse""]","Socrates addresses this in the *Meno* by distinguishing between:

*   **a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad.**
*   **b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.**

He argues that if someone desires something bad without realizing it, they actually desire something they *believe* to be good, even if it's actually bad. So, the appearance of desiring something bad is due to a lack of knowledge or a mistaken belief that the thing is actually good or beneficial in some way.
","Socrates argues that those who do not know things to be bad do not actually desire the bad things themselves; rather, they desire things they believe to be good, even if those things are actually bad in reality. He distinguishes between (a) desiring bad things while knowing they are bad and (b) desiring bad things while believing they are good, concluding that it is not in human nature to prefer what one thinks is bad over what is good.",0.7232993197175583,0.75,1.0,0.7865038107622756,Chunk 2000
Can you explain the three levels of potentiality and actuality using Aristotle’s example of a person speaking Greek?,"['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', ""3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-"", ""t is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work?

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2"", 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn', 'evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

Will it be a life in which one experiences lots of pleasure, has lots of money, garners lots of praise or honor, or what. Aristotle wants to know, what are the constituents of a happy life?

He is going to argue for what may seem a surprising conclusion: the perfect human life is one which consists in activity in accordance with virtue, i.e., human excellence; this is the life of human flourishing.\n\n3.

The existence of a human function (1097b28–33) ii. The nature of the human function (1097b33–1098a7) iii. The link between the human function and happiness (1098a7–20)3\n\ni.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good. What remains? • “An active life of the element [part of the soul] that has a rational principle” (1098a3–4).

(iii) ']","Okay, I can definitely clarify Aristotle's three levels of potentiality and actuality, using the example of a person speaking Greek.

Here's a breakdown:

Aristotle uses these levels to explain how something goes from having the *potential* to do something, to actually *doing* it. Think of it as a process of development or realization.

Here are the three levels, applied to the Greek-speaking example:

*   **i. First Potentiality (1P):** This is the most basic level of potential. It's the *potential for a potential*.

    *   **Example:** An infant has the *potential* to learn Greek. They aren't able to speak it *now*, but with the right kind of development and learning, they *could* acquire the ability. They have the raw capacity to develop the ability to speak Greek.
*   **ii. Second Potentiality (2P) / First Actuality (1A):** This is where the *potential* starts to become *real*. The capacity to speak Greek exists.

    *   **Example:** A person who has learned Greek and can speak it, but is currently sitting quietly. They aren't *actually* speaking Greek at this moment, but they *can* speak Greek if they choose to. The *potential* to speak Greek has been actualized (1A), even though it's not being actively used.
*   **iii. Second Actuality (2A):** This is the *full* realization of the potential. It's the active exercise of the capacity.

    *   **Example:** A person who is *actually* speaking Greek. They have the ability, and they are using it.

**In simpler terms:**

*   **1P:** The *capacity* to develop the *capacity* to speak Greek.
*   **2P/1A:** The *capacity* to speak Greek.
*   **2A:** *Actually* speaking Greek.

The course material also offers another way to think about it: ""something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that capacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.""

I hope this explanation helps clarify Aristotle's concept! Let me know if you have any further questions.
","The three levels are: (i) First potentiality (1P), where a human infant has the capacity to learn Greek; (ii) Second potentiality/first actuality (2P/1A), where a person has learned Greek and can speak it but is currently sitting quietly; and (iii) Second actuality (2A), which is the state of a person actually speaking Greek.",0.4303571428463839,1.0,1.0,0.882401532827346,Chunk 2000
What is Descartes' reason for undertaking a project of 'systematic doubt' in Meditation 1?,"['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSTUDY QUESTIONS for the Apology, Crito, and Euthyphro\n\nQuestions to Consider when Reading the Apology:\n\n1. Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living""(38a)? How are they connected? What\'s wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5. What reasons does Socrates give in the Crito for disregarding the views of the majority? Compare his views on this with the views of a cultural or moral relativist.\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Euthyphro:\n\n1. At 5d, Socrates asks Euthyphro ""What is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer: ""...to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...""?\n\n2. Socrates continues to press the question ""what is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer at 7a1: ""What is dear to the gods is pious....""?\n\n3. What is Socrates interested in finding something ""the same and alike"" in every pious action? Do you think there is something ""the same and alike"" in every pious (or just or courageous) action?\n\n4. Do Socrates and Euthyphro reach any conclusions about piety? If so, what are the conclusions? Do they agree on a definition of piety?\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n2', '24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocratic Definition and the Elenchus\n\nI. Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it', ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"", 'Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI.

Rather, because undermining the foundations will cause whatever has been built upon them to crumble of its own accord, I will attack straightaway those principles which supported everything I once believed.” (60)\n\nIII. Perception and Illusion Hypothesis: THE SENSES ARE A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nA.

Then you couldn’t draw the conclusion that things are as they appear. But, the naïf argues, of course we can sometimes tell that we are in favorable conditions (e.g. , “sitting here next to the fire, wearing my winter dressing gown” (60)). So:\n\nC. We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances; and if the circumstances are favorable then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: The “insane” can have mistaken beliefs even in ideal conditions.

Sometimes individuals hallucinate. • Note that in such cases there is no external interference, but there is an internal interference in one’s perceptual processes. So we need to rule out both to have secure foundations. • Descartes refuses to consider the possibility that he is insane: “But such people are mad, and I would appear no less mad, were I to take their behavior as an example for myself.” (60).\n\nSo we should adjust the principle:\n\nDescartes, René. Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy. 4th Edition. Translated by Donald A. Cress.\n\nHaslanger 1', 'D. We can distinguish favorable from unfavorable circumstances, and competent from incompetent perceivers; and if circumstances are favorable and the perceiver is competent, then whatever is sensed is as it appears to the senses.\n\nProblem: Even competent perceivers sometimes have vivid dreams. And “there are no definitve signs by which to distinguish being awake from being asleep” (60).\n\nHow often does my evening slumber persuade me of such ordinary things as these: that I am here, clothed in my dressing gown, seated next to the fireplace – when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! (60)\n\nDescartes’ point is that there is no “sure sign” based on the qualitative experience of dreaming that I am awake and not dreaming. • You might protest: Of course I can tell the difference between dreams and waking experience! Dreams\nhave a “dream-like quality.” And of course I can tell once I wake up I know I was dreaming before.\n•\nBut the claim that dreams have a ‘dream-like quality’ is of no use against the skeptical argument, if (i) the\n‘dream-like quality’ is only noticed once you wake up and remember what the dream was like, or (ii)\ndreams don’t always have the ‘dream-like quality’. What is needed is a sure sign, i.e., a sign that will\nalways be there to tell you are dreaming when you are.\n\nIV. Knowledge of A Priori Truth1 Perhaps we cannot find a sure foundation for perceptual knowledge, but there are other sorts of knowledge, e.g., knowledge of very general things (e.g. , that objects have color, shape, quantity, and so forth) and of things derived from this (e.g. , arithmetic, geometry). (61)\n\nHypothesis: REASON IS A SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE.\n\nProblem: Can we even reliably judge that we are in favorable circumstances and are competent reasoners? • God might have brought it about that I have mistaken beliefs about all these things. • But God is not a deceiver!!!\n\nProblem revisited: Perhaps in fact there is no God.

I will regard the heavens, the air, the earth, colors, shapes, sounds, and all external things as nothing but the\nbedeviling hoaxes of my dreams, with which he lays snares for my credulity. (62-3)\n\nCould a malicious demon not only undermine our confidence in experience of the external world, but also confidence in our reasoning about general things? It seems so, for the naïf concludes:\n\nBut eventually I am forced to admit that there is nothing among the things I once believed to be true which it is not permissible to doubt – and not out of frivolity or lack of forethought, but for valid and considered reasons. (62)\n\nQuestions: 1. Note that Descartes dismisses madness as a source of error and replaces it with dreaming. Why? One possibility is that the insane are not only confused about their experiences, but have defective reasoning powers. In the case of dreaming, we continue to assume that the agent’s reasoning powers are intact. But what about the malicious demon? Does the malicious demon also call into question our reasoning powers? If so, then how can we carry on in rational inquiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream. Is entitled to infer that therefore all experience may be a dream? Consider a fair lottery. Any number has the same chance of winning as any other number. It is true that anyone can win the lottery.

Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', 'd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer? Socrates claims to have human knowle', 'follows from this that one who lacks virtue, lacks moral knowledge, ie., is ignorant. But action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate. If doing harm is a failure of virtue, it must also be a failure of knowlege, and so be involuntary. (We will consider this in greater depth in connection with the Meno.)\n\nV. Socrates’ defense By engaging in philosophical inquiry, Socrates is living a virtuous life, and encouraging others to do the same; he is hardly corrupting the youth, in fact, he is the one most concerned with the state of their souls, and their virtue. And if he has done wrong, he has done so unwillingly, unintentionally.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it', ' piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the ""What is X?"" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to ""What is X?"" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X\'s, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor\'s virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: ""The Socratic Elenchus""\n\n24.01 1', ""3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-"", ""No doubt we have to reject the belief which seems weakest to us. Of course, further inquiry may show us that we gave up the wrong belief. But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge. Although he thinks his beliefs are consistent, inconsistency is sometimes difficult to find; only diligent testing and retesting will establish their coherence. He differs from his interlocutors because he, unlike they, respect the difficulty of achieving consistency in one's beliefs. Perhaps the only thing he can say he knows with confidence is that he lacks the required assurances of consistency, and so lacks knowledge.\n\nSome may want to push this idea even further. The fact that a set of beliefs is consistent is no guarantee of their truth. As we saw above, one might gain consistency in a set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of "", ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"", 'Cartesian Doubt in Meditation 1\n\nI. Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII. Method (i) “I realized that once in my life I had to raze everything to the ground and begin again from the original foundations, if I wanted to establish anything firm and lasting in the sciences” (59). [‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it. (In the Objections and Replies, Descartes uses the image of a barrel of apples that are beginning to rot. To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) ', 'uiry about doubt at all?\n\n2. Suppose that Descartes has established that any given experience may be a dream. Is entitled to infer that therefore all experience may be a dream? Consider a fair lottery. Any number has the same chance of winning as any other number. It is true that anyone can win the lottery. It doesn’t follow, however, that everyone can win the lottery. Is the reasoning about the lottery analogous to Descartes reasoning? Should we reject Descartes’ inference as well?\n\nDescartes, René.

**If a person S is knowledgeable about X, then S will be able to offer a Socratically-acceptable definition of X.**

In simpler terms, if you truly know something, you should be able to clearly explain and define it in a way that Socrates would find satisfactory.

The course material uses the example of virtue to illustrate this point: If someone possesses a virtue (V), they should be able to define what that virtue (V) is. For instance, a courageous person should be able to articulate a definition of courage.

The material then poses some questions for consideration:

Can these two positions be reco', 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB.

Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and duali', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal.

(413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn', 'es for the human function?\n\niii. The link between the human function and happiness Granting that the human function is “activity of the soul in accord with reason,” what does this tell us about the human good? The connection comes via an observation about performing one’s function well. The virtues proper to a kind are whatever capacities enable things of that kind to perform their function well . • The function of a paring knife is to cut fruits and vegetables. A good paring knife has certain virtues: it is sharp, and is easy to handle and wash. • Doctors also have a function: to heal the sick. Doctor virtues include knowledge of illnesses and cures and skill in applying this knowledge, a good bedside manner, an ability to organize their time. • So the human virtues are those capacities that enable humans to perform their function well. The function of humans is to lead a certain kind of life, and excellent humans (good people) are those who do that well. “And so the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue. In what follows, Aristotle delves into virtue—what it is and how we get it.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

All rights\n\nHaslanger 2']","Aristotle uses the examples of an axe and an eye to illustrate his concept of the soul as a specific kind of ability or function, not a separate, immaterial entity. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Axe:** The essence of an axe isn't just its shape (matter) but its ability to cut wood (form/soul). If an axe loses its ability to cut, it's no longer truly an axe, only in name. The ""soul"" of the axe is its function or purpose.
*   **Eye:** Similarly, the essence of an eye is not just its physical structure (matter) but its ability to see (form/soul). Without sight, it's just an eye in name, like a statue's eye. The ""soul"" of the eye is its capacity for sight.

The main point of these comparisons is to show that the soul is not some mysterious, independent entity, but rather the *ability* or *capacity* of a living thing to perform its characteristic functions. Just as the ability to cut is inseparable from a functional axe, and sight is inseparable from a functional eye, the soul is inseparable from the body. The soul plus the body constitutes the living thing.
","The comparisons illustrate that the soul is a capacity or power, not a separate substance. For an axe, its 'soul' would be 'being an axe' (its ability to cut). For an eye, its 'soul' would be sight. In both cases, the soul is inseparable from the material body (the wood/steel or the eye-jelly) and if the capacity is lost, the object is only that thing in name only.",0.37055555554814446,1.0,1.0,0.7909055336390699,Chunk 2000
Why does Socrates maintain that 'care of the soul' is the most important consideration in life?,"['ologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1', 'd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising...but on Socrates\' view a person becomes good by virtue of having knowledge, moreover, knowledge is something one can never be deprived of once one has it. Beat me, rob me, etc., and my knowledge\nremains. If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then\nno one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks! Consider again the thesis that virtue is (moral) knowledge. It follows from this that one who lacks virtue, lacks moral knowledge, ie., is ignorant. But action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate. If doing harm is a failure of virtue, it must also be a failure of knowlege, and so be involuntary. (We will consider this in greater depth in connection with the Meno.)\n\nV.

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living""(38a)? How are they connected? What\'s wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5. What reasons does Socrates give in the Crito for disregarding the views of the majority? Compare his views on this with the views of a cultural or moral relativist.\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Euthyphro:\n\n1. At 5d, Socrates asks Euthyphro ""What is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer: ""...to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...""?\n\n2. Socrates continues to press the question ""what is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer at 7a1: ""What is dear to the gods is pious....""?\n\n3. What is Socrates interested in finding something ""the same and alike"" in every pious action? Do you think there is something ""the same and alike"" in every pious (or just or courageous) action?\n\n4. Do Socrates and Euthyphro reach any conclusions about piety? If so, what are the conclusions? Do they agree on a definition of piety?\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M.

Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it', ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3"", 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it.

But we continue, doing the best we can, to test our beliefs for inconsistency, knowing that if we find an inconsistency then at least one of the beliefs is false. This suggests that through elenchtic inquiry we can never be certain that we have proven a target thesis false, or its negation true; the most we can claim to have proven is that one or another of the beliefs we considered is false.\n\nThis fact may be connected to Socrates' disavowal of knowledge. Through elenchtic inquiry he finds that his interlocutors are willing to assent to inconsistent claims; this shows that they have false beliefs, i.e., that they lack knowledge. His own commitment to elenchtic inquiry is a commitment to test his own beliefs for hidden inconsistencies. Perhaps he thinks that until he can show his beliefs to be wholly consistent, he is not entitled to claim knowledge. Although he thinks his beliefs are consistent, inconsistency is sometimes difficult to find; only diligent testing and retesting will establish their coherence. He differs from his interlocutors because he, unlike they, respect the difficulty of achieving consistency in one's beliefs. Perhaps the only thing he can say he knows with confidence is that he lacks the required assurances of consistency, and so lacks knowledge.\n\nSome may want to push this idea even further. The fact that a set of beliefs is consistent is no guarantee of their truth. As we saw above, one might gain consistency in a set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true.

Background on Descartes and the Meditations (i) René Descartes was born 1596, died 1650; he lived in France, Holland, and Sweden. (ii) He wrote on philosophy, but also on optics and mathematics (‘Cartesian coordinate system’). (iii) The Meditations on First Philosophy was published (in Latin) in 1641. Meditations were common as a religious genre, but less so for philosophy; both aim to engage and transform the reader: “I do not advise anyone to read these things but those who have the ability and desire to meditate seriously with me, and to withdraw their minds from the senses as well as from all prejudices.” Preface to the Reader, p. 52 (1998 Hackett edition, trans. Donald A. Cress).\n(iv) Who is the thinker/narrator? Not Descartes himself, but a fictional individual who is a naive believer in\ncommon sense. During the course of Meditation 1, the naïf is in internal conversation with the skeptic.\n\nII.

[‘sciences’ here means ‘systematic bodies of knowledge.’] (ii) “[I]t will suffice for the rejection of all these opinions, if I find in each of them some reason for doubt.” (59). • If someone suggests you should question your belief about something, do you decide to doubt everything you believe? Why is Descartes undertaking this project of systematic doubt? • Descartes thinks that the only way to discover whether his beliefs are trustworthy is to investigate their foundations. If one suspects that one’s house is unstable due to rotten timber, the solution is to demolish it, provide secure foundations, and rebuild it.

To prevent the rot from spreading, one tips all the apples out and inspects them, removing the rotten ones.) (iii) ', 's to investigate their foundations.

How does he proceed? “Nor therefore need I survey each opinion individually, a task that would be endless.

Dreams\nhave a “dream-like quality.” And of course I can tell once I wake up I know I was dreaming before.\n•\nBut the claim that dreams have a ‘dream-like quality’ is of no use against the skeptical argument, if (i) the\n‘dream-like quality’ is only noticed once you wake up and remember what the dream was like, or (ii)\ndreams don’t always have the ‘dream-like quality’.

One possibility is that the insane are not only confused about their experiences, but have defective reasoning powers.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Optical Illusions:** The course material explains that optical illusions, like a stick appearing bent in water, are examples of external interference in our perceptual processes. We can often identify these illusions and adjust our understanding of them, recognizing that they occur only in specific, unfavorable conditions.

*   **Dreaming:** Dreaming presents a deeper problem. Descartes argues that there are no definitive signs to distinguish being awake from being asleep. In dreams, we can have vivid experiences that seem entirely real, making it impossible to know for certain whether we are awake or dreaming at any given moment. This is a more fundamental challenge to the reliability of our senses than optical illusions, which can be explained away by external factors.

The key difference is that optical illusions are localized and can be accounted for, while dreaming casts doubt on the entirety of our sensory experience, even in what we believe to be ideal conditions.
","Optical illusions are 'external interference' that occur in unfavorable circumstances (like a stick looking bent in water). However, the 'dream argument' suggests that there are no 'definitive signs' to distinguish being awake from being asleep. This means that even when circumstances seem favorable and the perceiver seems competent, they could still be mistaken, undermining the reliability of the senses entirely.",0.3381944444359896,1.0,0.5625,0.9299287485881355,Chunk 2000
What is the difference between instrumental value and final value in Aristotle's framework of goods?,[],"Okay, I can certainly clarify the difference between instrumental and final value within Aristotle's framework of goods!

In Aristotle's philosophy, goods or values aren't all the same; he distinguishes them based on *why* we desire them. This distinction helps us understand what truly matters in living a good life. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Instrumental Value:** These are things we value as *means to an end.* We don't want them for their own sake, but because they help us get something else we *do* want. Think of them as tools or stepping stones.

    *   *Example:* Money. Most people don't want money just to have piles of it sitting around. They want it because it can buy them food, shelter, experiences, security, etc. So, money has instrumental value.
    *   *Another Example:* Studying for an exam. You might not enjoy the act of studying itself, but you do it because it leads to a good grade, which might lead to a better job, and so on.

*   **Final Value:** These are things we desire *for their own sake.* They are the ultimate goals or ends that we pursue. We value them intrinsically, and they don't need to lead to anything else to be worthwhile.

    *   *Example:* Happiness (or *eudaimonia* in Aristotle's terms, often translated as ""flourishing""). Aristotle argues that happiness is the ultimate good. We don't want to be happy in order to achieve something else; being happy is the goal itself.
    *   *Another Example:* Virtue. Aristotle believed that living a virtuous life was part of what it *means* to live well.

**In essence:**

*   Instrumental values are *means.*
*   Final values are *ends.*

Aristotle believed that our actions should ultimately be directed towards achieving final values, with happiness/flourishing being the highest of all. Recognizing this distinction can help us prioritize our lives and make choices that truly contribute to our well-being! Does this explanation clarify the difference for you?
","Ends of instrumental value are those pursued for the sake of other ends (for example, money is sought for the sake of buying things like yachts). Ends of final value are those that are not for the sake of other things but are desired for their own sake. Aristotle identifies the supreme good as having final value.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8764668569964034,Chunk 2000
What does Socrates mean by 'human wisdom' as opposed to divine knowledge?,"['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', 'ologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1', 'd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer? Socrates claims to have human knowle', 'have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer? Socrates claims to have human knowledge or human wisdom (eg., 20d), which he emphasizes is an awareness of how little he does know. If we allow that, correlated with human knowledge, there is a kind of human virtue (which is less than divine virtue and divine knowledge), then we can say that Socrates has this sort of human virtue. So: human knowledge, like human virtue, is fallible and consists largely in a kind of humility...Socrates has both, but lacks divine knowledge and divine virtue. (How is virtue connected to humility?)\n\n5. Obviously people harm good people all the time! How can Socrates deny this? This seems surprising...but on Socrates\' view a person becomes good by virtue of having knowledge, moreover, knowledge is something one can never be deprived of once one has it. Beat me, rob me, etc., and my knowledge\nremains. If the soul is of primary importance, if (moral) knowledge is what matters for the soul’s well-being, then\nno one can ever harm one with respect to that which really counts for happiness.\n\n6. But surely there are bad people who intentionally do wrong: torturers, serial killers....even people who steal or don’t stop at crosswalks! Consider again the thesis that virtue is (moral) knowledge. It follows from this that one who lacks virtue, lacks moral knowledge, ie., is ignorant. But action on the basis of ignorance is not deliberate. If doing harm is a failure of virtue, it must also be a failure of knowlege, and so be involuntary. (We will consider this in greater depth in connection with the Meno.)\n\nV.

Socrates’ defense By engaging in philosophical inquiry, Socrates is living a virtuous life, and encouraging others to do the same; he is hardly corrupting the youth, in fact, he is the one most concerned with the state of their souls, and their virtue.

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living""(38a)? How are they connected? What\'s wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5. What reasons does Socrates give in the Crito for disregarding the views of the majority? Compare his views on this with the views of a cultural or moral relativist.\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Euthyphro:\n\n1. At 5d, Socrates asks Euthyphro ""What is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer: ""...to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...""?\n\n2. Socrates continues to press the question ""what is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer at 7a1: ""What is dear to the gods is pious....""?\n\n3.

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2"", ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3""]","Based on the course materials, here's an explanation of what Socrates means by ""human wisdom"" as opposed to divine knowledge:

*   **Fallibility:** Socrates believes that human knowledge is fallible, meaning it's prone to error. Even with careful inquiry, some beliefs may be false. This contrasts with divine knowledge, which is infallible and perfect. Socrates acknowledges this fallibility in the elenchus.
*   **Awareness of Ignorance:** Human wisdom, for Socrates, is largely ""an awareness of how little he does know."" It's recognizing the limits of one's understanding.
*   **Humility:** Human wisdom is correlated with a kind of human virtue that emphasizes humility.

In essence, Socrates' ""human wisdom"" is the understanding that human knowledge is limited and imperfect, a humble recognition of one's own ignorance. This is different from a perfect, all-encompassing ""divine knowledge.""","Socrates' human wisdom is an awareness of his own ignorance and the recognition of how little he knows.

Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn', 'evels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAnother way to put this: something at the 1P stage has a capacity for a capacity; at the 2P/1A stage is has that\ncapacity; and at the 2A stage it is exercising that capacity. Matter, in a sense, is pure potentiality; form is what realizes that potential, but then brings along further potential.\n\nThis gives us the resources to understand the full definition of soul: “soul is the first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive. . . 412a27,” and again, “soul is the first actuality of a natural organic body” (412b5). The soul of an apple tree brings apple tree capacities; the soul of a dog, dog capacities; the soul of a human, human capacities. The exercise of these capacities makes us fully alive and fully who we are.\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition.

The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34).

Explain the Socratic claim that 'no one can harm a good person.',[],"Okay, let's explore the Socratic claim that ""no one can harm a good person."" This is a fascinating idea that gets to the heart of Socrates' philosophy!

**The Core Idea**

When Socrates says that no one can harm a good person, he doesn't mean that a good person can't be physically hurt or suffer misfortune. Instead, he's talking about harm to the *soul* or one's *moral character*. Socrates believed that true harm comes from within, from damaging one's own virtue and integrity. External events like imprisonment, poverty, or even death are not the real harm.

**Key Points to unpack this claim:**

1.  ***Virtue is the Only True Good:*** Socrates believed that virtue (moral excellence) is the most important thing in life, and the source of true happiness. Things like wealth, health, and reputation are secondary and don't guarantee happiness.
2.  ***Harm is Primarily Moral:*** For Socrates, the only real harm is that which corrupts the soul. This corruption comes from things like injustice, wickedness, and vice.
3.  ***Others Cannot Corrupt Your Soul:*** This is the crux of the argument. Socrates believed that other people can't *make* you immoral or unjust. While they might inflict physical harm or try to influence you, your moral character is ultimately under your own control. You always have the choice to act virtuously, no matter the external circumstances.
4.  ***Acting Unjustly Harms the Doer Most:*** Socrates would argue that a person who commits an unjust act is actually harming *themselves* more than their victim. By acting unjustly, they damage their own soul and diminish their own virtue.

**In simpler terms:**

Imagine a person who is truly good as having an inner compass that always points towards what is right and virtuous. External forces might try to knock them off course, but they can't change the direction of the compass itself. The only way the person can be truly harmed is if they choose to ignore their compass and act against their own moral principles.

**Example:**

Let's say a good person is falsely accused of a crime and imprisoned. Socrates would argue that while imprisonment is unpleasant, it doesn't truly harm the good person. They can still maintain their integrity, act with kindness towards others in prison, and remain true to their values. The people who falsely accused and imprisoned them, however, *have* harmed themselves by committing an injustice.

**Why is this claim so challenging?**

This idea is challenging because it goes against our common-sense understanding of harm. We tend to think of harm as something that is done *to* us by external forces. Socrates is asking us to shift our perspective and recognize that true harm is internal and related to our moral choices.

Do you have any further questions about this claim or would you like to explore any of these points in more detail?","Socrates believes that a person becomes good through (moral) knowledge, which is something that cannot be taken away. Since the soul and its moral well-being are of primary importance for happiness, external harms (like being robbed or beaten) do not affect what truly counts. Thus, a worse person cannot harm a good person because they cannot strip them of their virtue or knowledge.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.9006478844857219,Chunk 2000
Why does Descartes introduce the hypothesis of an 'evil genius' or 'malicious demon'?,[],"Okay, that's a great question! René Descartes introduces the ""evil genius"" or ""malicious demon"" hypothesis as a crucial step in his method of doubt, which is a central part of his philosophical project in *Meditations on First Philosophy*.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Radical Doubt:** Descartes wanted to establish a foundation of absolute certainty for knowledge. To do this, he decided to systematically doubt everything he thought he knew to see if anything could withstand the most extreme skepticism.
*   **Levels of Doubt:** He starts by doubting the reliability of his senses, as they sometimes deceive us. Then, he considers that he might be dreaming, which casts doubt on the existence of the external world.
*   **The Evil Genius:** The evil genius argument is the most radical level of doubt. Descartes realizes that even if he can doubt his senses and the existence of the external world, he might still trust in things that seem undeniably true, like mathematical truths (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). The evil genius hypothesis takes doubt to its absolute limit by suggesting that there might be a supremely powerful and cunning being who is deliberately deceiving him about everything, even these basic truths of mathematics and logic.

    *   **Purpose:** The introduction of the evil genius serves to challenge the certainty of everything Descartes believes, including reason itself. If such a being exists and is dedicated to deceiving him, then all his beliefs could be false, no matter how clear and distinct they seem.
*   **Seeking Certainty:** By pushing doubt to this extreme, Descartes aims to find something that even the evil genius could not deceive him about. This ""something"" will then serve as the absolutely certain foundation upon which he can build his system of knowledge.

In essence, the evil genius is a tool Descartes uses to test the limits of skepticism and to force himself to discover an indubitable truth.
","Descartes introduces the 'evil genius'—a being supremely powerful and clever—to see if he can doubt not just the external world, but also his reasoning about 'very general things' like arithmetic and geometry. This hypothesis allows him to admit that even his most basic rational judgments could be 'bedeviling hoaxes' designed to deceive him.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.7884358440951075,Chunk 2000
"What is hylomorphism, and how does it distinguish Aristotle's view of the soul from Plato's?","['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', 'ologia’ which means defense.

A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?).

Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).)

Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it', 'Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB.

All rights\n\nHaslanger\n\n1', 'This brings out the idea that soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.\n\nC. Second comparison: body and soul are like an axe and ‘the account of an axe’.\n\nSuppose that a tool, e.g. an axe, were a natural body, then being an axe would have been its essence and so its soul. (412b14)\n\nThis comparison brings out the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability: what it is to be an axe (what is involved in the account, or definition, of an axe) is to be able to cut wood. The form of an axe is not just a certain shape (unlike the form of a statue), but a certain shape organized to do something. If the axe loses that ability, it ceases to be an axe, except in name. But the ability to cut is not some mysterious invisible being, capable of separation from the wood and steel of the axe. Likewise for the soul.\n\nD. Third comparison: body and soul are like the eye and sight.\n\nSuppose that the eye were an animal—sight would have been its soul, for sight is the substance of the eye which corresponds to the account, the eye being merely the matter of seeing; when seeing is removed the eye\nis no longer an eye, except in name—no more than the eye of a statue or of a painted figure. (412b19-22)\n\nThis comparison brings out more vividly the idea that soul might be a certain kind of ability. The form of an eye is not just a certain shape, but a certain power. Sight is the ability to see: and without that ability, there is no eye,\nstrictly speaking. But again, sight is not some mysterious, invisible being, capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and duali', ' capable of existing without the eye-jelly.\nLikewise for the soul:\n\nAs the pupil [eye-jelly] plus the power of sight constitutes the eye, so the soul plus the body constitutes the\nanimal. From this it indubitably follows that the soul is inseparable from its body, or at any rate that certain parts of it are (if it has parts)... (413a4)\n\nSo Aristotle provides an alternative to materialism and dualism.\n\n3. Forms of life\n\nSoul is what makes something alive. But life brings different capacities in different sorts of things. Life in an apple tree, or a dog, or a human, entails different abilities. Soul enables a living thing to fulfill the powers or functions of that kind of thing, whether nutrition, movement, perception or thought. In fact, soul is identical to those powers and functions. However, this does not mean that one is only alive if one is constantly exercising one’s full capacities! That is because there are two grades or levels of capacities.\n\nNow the word ‘actuality’ has two senses corresponding respectively to the possession of knowledge and the actual exercise of knowledge.” (412a22).\n\nThis is all best explained with examples. Consider a human infant. We might say that an infant can speak Greek, meaning that they have a capacity to learn the language. Once someone learns a language, they aren’t constantly speaking, however. So we might say of someone sitting quietly that they can speak Greek. This capacity is different from the infant’s capacity. Moreover, a person who can speak Greek in the second sense\nmight also be actively speaking Greek. This gives us three levels of potentiality/actuality:\ni. First potentiality (1P): infant can speak Greek if they undergo certain significant changes (learning the language) ii.\nSecond potentiality (2P)/first actuality (1A): quiet speaker can speak Greek if prompted to – the first\npotentiality has been actualized, even if the speaker isn’t actually speaking. iii. Second actuality (2A): person actually speaking Greek\nAn']","Okay, I can certainly help you understand hylomorphism and how it relates to Aristotle's view of the soul, especially in contrast to Plato.

**Hylomorphism Explained**

Hylomorphism is a philosophical theory developed by Aristotle that explains reality in terms of two fundamental principles: matter and form. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Matter:** Matter is the ""stuff"" of which things are made. It is potentiality, meaning it has the potential to become something. Think of it as raw material.
*   **Form:** Form is what gives matter its structure, organization, and characteristics. It is actuality, meaning it is what makes something a specific thing. Form determines what the matter will become.

The text uses the example of a statue to illustrate this concept: ""Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form, which makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.""

**Hylomorphism and the Soul**

Aristotle applies hylomorphism to living things, with the soul being the form and the body being the matter. In this view, the soul isn't a separate, independent entity that inhabits the body (as Plato thought). Instead, the soul is the *organization* and *structure* of the body that allows it to perform its life functions. The soul is what makes a living thing alive.

The text provides a few helpful comparisons:

*   **Wax and its shape:** Just as you can't separate the wax from its shape, you can't separate the soul from the body.
*   **Axe and ""the account of an axe"":** The soul is like the ability of an axe to cut. Without that ability, it's no longer truly an axe.
*   **Eye and sight:** The soul is like sight, which is the ability of the eye to see. Without sight, the eye is just an object, not a functional eye.

**Aristotle's View vs. Plato's View**

The key difference between Aristotle and Plato lies in their understanding of the relationship between the soul and the body:

*   **Plato:** Plato was a dualist, believing that the soul and body are distinct and separate. In Plato's *Phaedo*, the soul is immortal and can exist independently of the body. The body is like a prison for the soul.
*   **Aristotle:** Aristotle rejects dualism. He argues that the soul and body are interdependent. The soul is the form of the body, and the body is the matter that is organized by the soul. They cannot exist separately. As the text says, ""...soul is form, body is matter, and that you would not have the one without the either—contrary to Plato, they are interdependent.""

In summary, hylomorphism is the view that things are composed of matter and form, and Aristotle uses this framework to understand the soul as the form of a living body, in contrast to Plato's dualistic view of a separate soul.","Hylomorphism is the view that all ordinary things are a complex of form and matter. Aristotle identifies the body as matter (potentiality) and the soul as form (actuality). Unlike Plato's dualism, which sees the soul and body as independent and separable entities, Aristotle's hylomorphism views them as interdependent aspects of a single individual, like the wax and its shape.",0.35436507935799205,1.0,1.0,0.9472013212777107,Chunk 2000
"What are the four assumptions Socrates brings to his quest for definitions, as seen in the Euthyphro?","['24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nThe Apology and Crito\n\n1. Background on Socrates and Plato\n\n(a) Socrates (469–399 BCE)\n\ni. His mother may have been a midwife, his father a stonecutter; he himself had a wife (Xanthippe) and several children. Socrates served in the Athenian army during the Peloponnesian War. Other than this, he never left Athens and its vicinity.\n\nii. Most famous as a barefoot, unwashed, snub-nosed, bug-eyed, incessantly inquisitive man. Although he never\nwrote anything down, he attracted quite a following. One of those followers was Plato.\n\n(b) Plato (427–347 BCE)\n\ni. From an aristocratic family and probably expected to go in to politics; instead, he turned to philosophy. After Socrates’ death, Plato spent about a decade abroad, perhaps studying with members of the Pythagorean “cult” in Italy. In the 380s, he returned to Athens and founded a school: the Academy.\n\nii. At the Academy, Plato taught philosophy, but probably also mathematics1 and political science. It was something of a think tank. Many bright young intellectuals passed through his school, including Aristotle.\n\nAlthough Socrates never wrote a word, there is no doubt that he existed. There is plenty of doubt, however, about what he thought. The main source of evidence for his views include a historian (Xenophon), a playwright (Aristophanes), and a philosopher (Plato). In fact, in most of Plato’s dialogues, Socrates is the protagonist. But was Plato just using Socrates as his mouthpiece?\n\nII. General remarks on the Apology\n\n(a) The title: ‘apology’ is from the Greek ‘apologia’ which means defense. (As you surely noted, Socrates is not especially apologetic.)\n\n(b) Ancient Athenian legal procedure: Athens was a “direct democracy.” All “citizens,” i.e., the adult (>age 20)\nmales who owned land and weren’t slaves, had a vote. A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the', 'ologia’ which means defense.

A smaller group (>age 30) served in the judicial court.\nThe prosecution and defense each make speeches; the jury (there were no judges, in the contemporary sense) votes on the verdict; the prosecution and defense each propose penalties; the jury votes on the penalty.\n\n(c) The Apology is likely an early work, possibly one of Plato’s first (although can’t date it precisely). It is not plausibly an historically correct representation of the trial, but may capture something of Socrates’ ideas and personality.\n\nIII. Characteristic Socratic Theses Socrates realized that his defense was not only a response to the specific charges; those he was apt to flatly deny. He was on trial also for his way of life. His challenge was to show the jury that his life was a life of virtue, and so could not be a basis for charges of impiety and corruption.\n\na) Care of the soul is of primary importance.\nApology: 29e-30b, 36c\nCrito: 47e-48b\n\nb) In considering what course of action to follow, one should only consider what is right/wrong, just/unjust.\nApology: 28b\nCrito: 48c-d\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge (a skill in practical reasoning?). Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\nApology: 30a-31a, 36c-37a, 38a\nCorollary: The unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n1', 'd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all. Apology: 20c, 20e, 21d, 23b\n\ne) No one can harm a good person.\nApology: 30c-d, 41c-d\n\nf) No one deliberately does harm [injustice].\nApology: 25d-26a\n\nIV. Connections between the theses\n\n1. Why is the care of the soul of primary importance? What else might matter? The ordinary person might think that satisfying one\'s desires is of primary importance and the route to happiness. In contrast, Socrates maintains that the care of the soul is of utmost importance because a cared for soul is the basis of happiness and virtue. (Why think this? Isn’t satisfaction of desire what makes us happy?)\n\n2. Why, in determining how to act, is acting justly the only consideration that matters? Injustice harms the soul. One who behaves badly will harm what is most valuable. (How does injustice or wrongdoing harm the soul?)\n\n3. Why does doing philosophy matter? Why would Socrates rather die than stop doing philosophy? If virtue is (moral) knowledge, then one is virtuous if and only if they have (moral) knowledge. If we grant that philosophical inquiry is a route to moral knowledge, then this will be a basis for achieving virtue, and so will be morally therapeutic. A corrollary of this is that the unexamined life is not worth living, because it will be a life without knowledge, and so without virtue. (Is the unexamined life really not worth living???)\n\n4. What does Socrates mean when he claims not to have knowledge? Socrates\' disavowal of knowledge is one of his most distinctive claims, and yet it seems paradoxical, given what we have just considered. • Socrates seems make some further claims to knowledge (eg., at 29b he says, ""I do know that it is wicked and shameful to do wrong, to disobey one\'s superior, be he god or man). •\nSocrates does suggest that he has virtue, but if virtue = moral knowledge, and he does not have moral\nknowledge, how can he have virtue? • Suggestion for answer?

Socrates suggests that there are two sets of accusations which are being brought against him. What are the accusations? What are the differences between the two sets? Why were they brought against him (do you think there might be some unstated reasons)?\n\n2. Socrates claims to have a divine mission. What is the mission? Why did he choose to die rather than give it up? If the divine mission calls him to action here on earth, isn\'t allowing himself to be executed a way of giving it up? Why or why not?\n\n3. Socrates claims that a good person cannot be harmed by a worse person, and suggests that a person who does harm is worse off than the victim of the harm (30d). What are his reasons for believing this? Do you agree?\n\n4. At 26a, Socrates says ""Either I do not corrupt the young, or, if I do, it is unwillingly...."" What is the argument which leads him to this conclusion?\n\n5. Socrates believes that wickedness is worse than death (""death is something I couldn\'t care less about...my whole concern is not to do anything unjust or impious"" (32d).) Is this belief connected to the claim that ""the unexamined life is not worth living""(38a)? How are they connected? What\'s wrong with an unexamined life?\n\n6. Does Socrates have wisdom or not? What is the nature of his wisdom? Does he believe he has wisdom?\n\n7. Is Socrates’ defense convincing? How would you have voted at his trial?\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Crito (recommended text):\n\n1. Socrates argues in the Apology that if he were put in the position of having to choose between obeying the authority of the laws and the authority of god, he would be right to choose the authority of god. Yet in the Crito, Socrates claims that we are bound by our just agreements, and that he has made an agreement with the city to obey its laws. Can these two positions be reco', '5. What reasons does Socrates give in the Crito for disregarding the views of the majority? Compare his views on this with the views of a cultural or moral relativist.\n\nQuestions to consider when reading the Euthyphro:\n\n1. At 5d, Socrates asks Euthyphro ""What is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer: ""...to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...""?\n\n2. Socrates continues to press the question ""what is the pious?"". On what basis does Socrates reject Euthyphro\'s answer at 7a1: ""What is dear to the gods is pious....""?\n\n3. What is Socrates interested in finding something ""the same and alike"" in every pious action? Do you think there is something ""the same and alike"" in every pious (or just or courageous) action?\n\n4. Do Socrates and Euthyphro reach any conclusions about piety? If so, what are the conclusions? Do they agree on a definition of piety?\n\nPlato. Five Dialogues: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Meno, Phaedo (Hackett Classics). 2nd Edition. Edited by John M. Cooper.\n\n2', '24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocratic Definition and the Elenchus\n\nI. Recap of some Socratic theses:\n\nc) Virtue is a form of moral knowledge. Philosophical inquiry is morally therapeutic.\n\nd) Socrates knows that he does not have knowledge, and that is all.\n\nThe articulation condition: If a person S is knowledgeable about X, S will be able to offer a [Socratically-acceptable]\ndefinition of X.\n\nIf we combine the articulation condition with with (c), then if someone S has a virtue V, then S will know what V is, i.e., they will be able to give a definition of V. For example, a courageous person should be able to say what courage is.\n\n• Why? Is this plausible? Compare: o If I am knowledgeable about zebras, I will be able to explain what zebras are. o If I am knowledgeable about courage, I will be able to explain what courage is. o If I know how to tie a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am an expert in tying a square knot, I will be able to explain how to tie a square knot. o If I am truly courageous, I will be able to explain what courage is (or how to be courageous?).\n\nII. The Socratic Quest for Definitions Regardless of the question being raised in discussion, Socrates typically leads the conversation to a concern with definition: What is virtue? What is piety? What is courage? What is knowledge? He brings to this several assumptions. (In the Euthyphro the issue is piety.)\n\nCommonality: There is a form (eidos) of piety that is the same in all and only pious things. (5d2-5)\n\nExplanatory Priority: The form of piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it', ' piety makes pious actions pious, i.e., it is what is responsible for their being pious,\nand explains why they are pious. (6d10-e1)\n• the form is the essence or nature of piety\n\nIdeal/Standard: The form is a standard by which to judge which things are pious and which are impious. (6e3-6)\n\nObject of Definition: This form or nature or essence of piety is what we seek in giving a definition, i.e., it will provide the correct answer to the ""What is X?"" question.\n\nCorollaries: 1. The answer to ""What is X?"" cannot be an individual instance of X, since it must be common to all instances. 2. Because the form must be the standard or ideal pattern for X\'s, it cannot be qualified by its opposite, i.e., it\ncannot be not-X.\n3. Since one role of the standard is to provide a basis for recognizing instances, we can make knowledgeable claims about instances of X, only if we have a definition.\n\nIII. The Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus1\n\nPurpose: The Socratic elenchus has a double purpose: to discover truths about how one ought to live and to test the interlocutor to determine if they are living a moral life. Thus, its purpose is both philosophical and therapeutic. The elenchus will provide a test of the interlocutor\'s virtue, and will assist one in the task of becoming virtuous only if participation is sincere.\n\nProcedure: 1. The interlocutor asserts a thesis P which Socrates considers false and targets for refutation. 2. Socrates secures agreement to some further premises, e.g., Q, and R. Q and R are (usually) not argued for.\n\n1 Adapted from G. Vlastos: ""The Socratic Elenchus""\n\n24.01 1', ""3. Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, that Q and R entail not-P.\n4. Thereupon, Socrates claims that P (the target thesis) has been shown false, not-P true.\n\nExample: (taken from Euthyphro 5c-6e with some re-ordering and adjustments):\n\nQuestion: What is piety and impiety, both with regards murder and other things?\n\nTarget thesis (P): The pious is what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer...not to prosecute is impious. Auxiliary hypotheses agreed upon: (Q): The pious itself is the same and alike in every pious action. (R): There are many other pious actions other than prosecuting the wrongdoer.\nTherefore, (not-P): Then it is not the case piety (or the pious) is prosecuting the wrongdoer (because prosecuting\nis not common to all pious actions).\n\nIn this passage Socrates aims to refute the proposal (P), by showing that it conflicts with other beliefs Euthyphro holds, viz., (Q), (R). One cannot consistently hold that piety is what is common to all pious actions, that piety is prosecuting the wrongdoer, and that prosecuting the wrongdoer is not common to all pious actions. This example is not only a paradigm of elenchtic argument, but is also a paradigm of Socrates' quest for definition.\n\nA more difficult argument is an argument relying on the condition of explanatory priority: Euthyphro on Piety:\n9d1-11b1\n1) Target thesis: What is pious (i.e., what piety is) = what is loved by (all) the gods. (To be pious = to be loved by\nall the gods). 2) Piety is what makes actions pious.\n\nBut:\n\n3) The gods love what is pious because it is pious,\n4) NOT: The gods love what is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-"", ""t is pious because it is god-loved.\n\nContrast:\nBeing pious is what makes actions god-loved.\nBeing god-loved is what makes actions pious.\n\nHow exactly does this argument work? Is it convincing?\n\nIV. Questions (Extra) Is Socrates entitled to claim, on the basis of his method, that he has proven the target thesis false? I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2"", ""set of beliefs by rejecting one which is, as a matter of fact, true. It might be that this danger was what prevented Socrates from claiming knowledge. Even if he were confident in the consistency of his beliefs (due to years of conscientious elenchtic inquiry), he must acknowledge that his inquiry is fallible, that some of his beliefs may nevertheless be false. This fallibility is the hallmark of human knowledge, and what distinguishes it from infallible divine knowledge. Socrates' human wisdom is to acknowledge this fallibility in the elenchus, which is the best procedure we humans have to achieve knowledge.\n\n24.01\n\n3""]","Based on the course materials, Socrates brings the following assumptions to his quest for definitions:

1.  **Commonality:** There is a single form (eidos) that is the same in all and only instances of the concept being defined (e.g., piety).
2.  **Explanatory Priority:** The form is what makes instances of that concept what they are. For example, the form of piety is what makes pious actions pious and explains why they are pious. It's the essence or nature of piety.
3.  **Ideal/Standard:** The form serves as a standard for judging which things exemplify the concept and which do not. It's a benchmark.
4.  **Object of Definition:** This form, essence, or nature is what Socrates seeks to capture in a definition.

I.e., is\nSocrates entitled to conclude that the hypothesis (P) is false and (not-P) true because he has shown that (P) is\ninconsistent with some further agreed upon premises?\n\nThe worry behind this question stems from the observation that one can avoid inconsistency in a set of beliefs by denying any one of the set. In the example considered, Euthyphro need not have agreed with Socrates to reject the target thesis. Instead, he might have chosen to reject (Q), viz., that the pious itself is the same in every pious action, or (R), viz., that there are other sorts of pious actions besides prosecuting the wrongdoer; in doing so, he would still avoid inconsistency. In fact, Socrates' interlocutors typically agree with him that the thesis to reject is the target thesis, but this doesn't avoid the problem. The question remains: how do we know which belief to give up when we find an inconsistency in our beliefs? What conclusions should we draw about the individual beliefs when we find an inconsistency?\n\nExample: 1. (P) Jones is the best chess player in town. 2. (Q) The best player always wins. 3. (R) Jones lost last night to Smith.\n\nGiven that we believe (1-3), and that they are not consistent, what should we conclude? We have 3 options:\n\n4. (not-P) Jones is not the best chess player in town.\n5. (not-Q) It is not the case that the best player always wins. (Sometimes the best player loses.)\n6. (not-R) Jones did not lose last night to Smith.\n\n24.01\n\n2"", ""24.01: Classics of Western Philosophy Prof. Sally Haslanger\n\nSocrates on Weakness of Will\n\nOne of Socrates' most puzzling views is the claim that akrasia, or weakness of will, is impossible. We seem to encounter weakness of will on a daily basis. What is weakness of will? Standardly, cases of weakness of will are characterized as those in which one knows or believes that a certain action is better than another, but voluntarily does the worse action instead.\n\nThere seem to be many ways this can occur. For example, in spite of my judgment that it is best not to have a cigarette with my morning coffee, I may nevertheless go ahead and indulge, while continuing to think that the best thing for me to do would be to forego it. Or, in spite of my judgment that it would be far better for me to give my lottery winnings to charity rather than use the sum to buy a second home in the Caribbean, I may nevertheless use it to buy the second home, and give none of it to charity.\n\nYet Socrates seems to maintain that such incontinent actions are not possible. He claims, e.g., in the\ndialogue Protagoras (See also Apology 25d8-26a7):\n\nNo one who either knows or believes that something else, which is in his power to do, is better than what he is doing, subsequently does the other, when he can do what is better.\n(358b7-c1)\nand: No one freely goes for bad things or things he believes to be bad; it's not...in human nature to be prepared to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good. And when he is forced to choose one of two evils, nobody will choose the greater when he\ncan have the lesser. (358c6-d4)\n\nI. Desire and action in the Meno\n\nDo you think, Meno, that anyone, knowing that bad things are bad, nevertheless desires them? --I\ncertainly do.\nWhat do you mean by desiring? Is it to secure for oneself? --What else?\nDoes he think that the bad things benefit him who possesses them, or does he know they harm him? There are some who believe that the bad things benefit them, o"", 'no. He points out the distinction to Meno between: a) Desiring bad things, knowing or believing they are bad. b) Desiring bad things, not knowing or believing they are bad.\n\nHe argues that if one desires something bad, not knowing it is, then the object of one\'s desire is something believed good, even if actually bad. In short, he argues that:\n\nIf one believes an action to be good, then one will desire to do it; and If one believes an action to be bad, then one will not desire to do it.\n\nThe point here is to link our evaluations with our desires. Consider our practices of evaluation. Often we make initial evaluations of courses of action, and find that several actions might be good, or that one action appears better than another. As we proceed in our evaluations, weighing all the pros and cons, we finally come to a judgment about what\'s the best thing for us to do in the circumstances. Socrates is proposing that this evaluation leads us to action: we want to do what we judge to be overall best in the circumstances. As he puts it in the quote mentioned: ""it is not in human nature to go for what you think to be bad in preference to what is good."" But once we\'ve modified his claim to read:\n\nNo one desires what one judges overall to be bad; one desires what one judges overall to be good.\n\nThe claim seems much more plausible. And if we revise the other premises accordingly, then we are faced with the paradox of denying weakness of will. E.g.,\n\n1*) If one believes that an action is bad/evil, then one will not desire to do it; and if\none believes the action is good, then one will desire to do it.\n\n2*) If one desires to perform or avoid an action, and it is in one\'s power to do so, then\none will do so.\n\nFrom this it appears that we can conclude:\n\n3*) If one believes that an action is good, and it is in one\'s power to perform it, then one will perform it;\nand if one believes that the action is bad, and it is in one\'s power to avoid it, then one will avoid it.\n\n2', ""This argument is more plausible than our initial (1)-(3) and doesn’t entail that wrongdoing is always\ninvoluntary. But this argument still yields a conclusion which denies weakness of will, which is also problematic. What are we to do? All of the premises seem plausible, but they are inconsistent with the common sense claim that:\n\nSometimes I judge an action to be overall best, and nevertheless fail to perform it.\n\nIII. Possible responses:\n\n• As a matter of fact, weakness of will is impossible. Ordinary cases are not what they may seem, i.e.,\n(3*) is unproblematic.\n• The premise that we always desire what we judge best is false; judgment and desire is not linked in\nthis way, i.e., (1*) is false.\n•\nThe premise that we always act on our desires (where possible) is false, i.e., (2*) is false.\n\nDivide and Conquer? So far we have not distinguished different ways that something can be bad. On one hand things which\nare harmful, or against our self-interest are bad for us; on the other hand things may be judged morally\ngood or bad. If we are sensitive to this distinction we may see that the argument can be divided into two different conclusions:\n\nIf I judge that an action is best for me, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it. If I judge that an action is morally best, and it is in my power to perform it, then I will perform it.\n\nConsider how this distinction might affect Socrates' crucial premise:\n\nNo one desires what they judge to be (morally) bad. No one desires what they judge to be harmful (bad for them).\n\nThe first is clearly less plausible than the second, since people may make judgments not only on the basis of moral right and wrong, but factoring in other things they value. Ie., our desires may be responsive to other concerns besides moral value. But this in fact suggests that there are two paradoxical ideas at stake:\n\nPrudential paradox:\n\nNo one desires what's bad or harmful (for oneself).

All those who act immorally and do what is wrong do so involuntarily, i.e., out of ignorance.\n\nIV. Where are we now?\n\ni) We are still left with the prudential paradox if we grant the claim that people don't desire what they judge to be bad for them and they act on their desires.\n\nii) Are there reasons to take seriously the moral paradox? What if we assume that doing the right thing is\nin our self-interest?\n\n3""]","Okay, I can explain the Prudential and Moral Paradoxes as they relate to Socrates' views on action, based on the text you provided.

**Prudential Paradox:**

*   **Core Idea:** The paradox arises from the idea that people always act in their best self-interest. It suggests that no one *desires* what is bad or harmful for themselves. Therefore, if someone pursues something bad or harmful, they must be doing so *involuntarily*.
*   **Underlying Assumption:** People don't knowingly choose what they believe will harm them.

**Moral Paradox:**

*   **Core Idea:** This paradox links virtue with knowledge. It posits that virtue *is* moral knowledge; you're virtuous if and only if you possess moral knowledge. Consequently, if someone acts immorally or does wrong, they do so *involuntarily*, out of ignorance.
*   **Underlying Assumption:** Immoral actions stem from a lack of understanding of what is truly good and right.

In essence, both paradoxes grapple with the relationship between our desires, our judgments (of what's good or bad, beneficial or harmful), and our actions. They suggest that people never knowingly choose what they believe to be bad, whether ""bad"" means harmful to themselves or morally wrong.

I hope this explanation is helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Aristotle lists 'self-sufficiency' as a requirement for the supreme good. How does he define a 'self-sufficient' life?,"['Matter and Form, Body and Soul, in De Anima\n\n•\nFollow-up on Final argument in Plato’s Phaedo.\n• Introduction to Aristotle (see additional biographical handout).\n\n1. Hylomorphism\n\nUnlike Plato, Aristotle was fascinated by the natural world. Instead of Plato’s division between two vastly different realms, Aristotle distinguishes two aspects of ordinary things – form and matter. Form only exists when it enforms matter; moreover, matter is just potential to be enformed. Aristotle identifies matter with potentiality, form with actuality. Think of a carved statue: the wood is the matter, the potential statue; the shape is the form,\nwhich makes it an actual statue; the matter/form complex is the individual thing, the statue.\n\nIn the case of artifacts like statues, we impose form on the matter. But the form/matter in statues is just an\nanalogy to help us understand the basic idea. Aristotle was mainly interested in explaining the characteristic changes in and growth and development of natural things. Why does water boil when heated and freeze when cold? Why do some trees produce apples and others oranges? Why do human embryos develop into adult humans and dog embryos develop into adult dogs? This can’t be explained simply by their matter (which is basically the same stuff), but by the form that makes something water, or an apple tree, or a human, i.e., in virtue of which the things are what they are. In ‘On the Soul’ we find Aristotle applying his wider metaphysical views to the topic of living things.\n\n2. What is soul?\n\nA. Basics Note that ‘soul’ translates psuchē (cf. ‘psyche’). In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Arist', 'In its most basic sense, the psuchē is what gives life to living things. This is the sense Aristotle is working with. Aristotle takes it for granted that to have a soul is to be alive:\nand ‘by life we mean self-nutrition and growth and decay’. So even plants have a kind of psychē. But humans\nhave a more complex psuchē. Broadly speaking, there are three classes of capacities of living things. Aristotle\narranges these hierarchically: higher-order living things possess all the capacities of lower-level living things:\ni. Nutrition (and generation): plants and animals ii. Perception: all animals iii. Thinking (or understanding): humans and “any thinking being that is different from, or superior to, a human being,” e.g., God. (414b17).\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle’s view it helps to consider some rival conceptions of soul: dualism and materialism.\n\nDualism is the view that souls and bodies are radically different kinds of things, separable from one another, independent from one another. Souls are immaterial, bodies are material. Plato’s Phaedo seems to offer a version of dualism.\n\nMaterialism (properly speaking: reductive materialism) is the view that there are only material bodies of one sort or another. If there are souls, they are to be identified with material bodies.\n\nAristotle rejects both of these options:\n\nNow given that there are bodies of such and such a kind, viz. having life, the soul cannot be a body; for the body is the subject or matter, not what is attributed to it. Hence the soul must a substance in the sense of the\nform of a natural body having life potentially within it. (412a19-21)\n\nIn the case of living things, the body is the matter, and the soul is the form, the soul is the ‘form of a natural body having life potentially within it’.\n\nB. First comparison: body and soul are like wax and its shape.\n\n…we can dismiss as unnecessary the question whether the soul and the body are one: it is as though we were to ask whether the wax and its shape are on', 'Aristotle on Happiness Nichomachean Ethics, Book I\n\n1. Goods and ends: some structural features (Bk I, Chs 1-2)\n\nThe overarching aim of the Nichomachean Ethics is to inquire into what makes for a good human life.\n\nIf… there is some end of the things we do, which we desire for its own sake (everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good. (1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .', '(everything else being desired for the sake of this), and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else (for at that rate the process would go on to infinity, so that our desire would be empty and vain), clearly this must be the good, and the chief good. (1094a:20)\n\nIs there a supreme good for humans? i.\nWe, as rational creatures, engage in end-directed (goal-directed) activities .\nii. Some of the ends (e.g., money) are for the sake of other ends (e.g., yachts). They are of instrumental value. iii. Other ends don’t seem to be for the sake of other things. They are of final value. iv. If there are no things of final value, the considerations motivating our choices “will go on without limit, so that desire will prove to be empty and futile” (1094a20–21). • Note: this observation alone doesn’t establish that there is only one final good. iv. The supreme good for humans (if there is such a thing) will be of final value.\n\nAristotle seems to think that in order to live a well-ordered life, that life must be organized around an ultimate or\nsupreme good that is the goal or end of all action. Why? Practical reason enables us to determine what means are appropriate given certain ends; this allows that we might have many ends in life. But when the ends conflict we are either stuck with no way to (rationally) proceed, or we must have some way of ordering the ends, i.e., a way to rank them in order of priority. [Example: Sartre’s example of staying to care with your mother or joining the French resistance.]\n\nAristotle thought the way to provide this rank ordering of ends was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered. Thus, in the well-ordered life there is some ultimate end towards which all\naction, desire, activity, is directed.1 Many of us are irrational and our lives are a mess because our lives are not ordered around a supreme good. The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (a', "" was to have some one ultimate end in terms of\nwhich the others could be ordered.

The goal of his project is to figure out if there is a single supreme good that is good for (all) humans. • Why assume that the supreme good is the same for all of us? Wouldn’t it be more plausible to say that some of us flourish as professors, others as doctors, others as musicians, others as carpenters, etc.? Each human life might be directed towards a supreme good, but not the same one.]\n\n2. The good for humans: common beliefs and some formal requirements (Bk I, Chs 4–7)\n\nAristotle thinks that most people will agree that the good for humans is happiness. As we’ve noted before,\n‘happiness’ translates ‘eudaimonia’ which could also be translated as ‘flourishing.’ (The word is a compound of ‘eu-’\nmeaning ‘good or well’ and ‘daimon’ meaning ‘a minor divinity’—or better, ‘guardian spirit.’) Someone is eudaimon when things are going really well for her.\n\nHappiness has several important features that seem to make it uniquely suited to be the supreme good. It is: a) Final: it is chosen for its own sake. b) Complete: It is aimed for purely as an end, and not also as a means or instrument to other things (Aristotle suggests that it is the only ‘complete’ end.)\nc) Self-sufficient: A happy life lacks nothing.\n•\n“The self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lacking in\nnothing; and such we think happiness to be.” (1097b:18)\n\nBut the story doesn't stop when we conclude that happiness is the supreme good. Everyone may agree on this,\n\nPojman, Louis P., and Lewis Vaughn. Classics of Philosophy. 3rd edition. Oxford University Press, 2010 © Oxford University Press.

Will it be a life in which one experiences lots of pleasure, has lots of money, garners lots of praise or honor, or what. Aristotle wants to know, what are the constituents of a happy life? (1097b22–24) What does it take to be happy, truly happy? Can we characterize the life of complete human flourishing? What would such a life include? He is going to argue for what may seem a surprising conclusion: the perfect human life is one which consists in activity in accordance with virtue, i.e., human excellence; this is the life of human flourishing.\n\n3.

The Function Argument (Bk I, Ch 7) Note that the the word translated as ‘function’ is ‘ergon .’ It could also be translated as ‘work,’ ‘business,’ ‘proper work,’ or ‘characteristic activity.’\n\nThere are three stages to the Function Argument: i. The existence of a human function (1097b28–33) ii. The nature of the human function (1097b33–1098a7) iii. The link between the human function and happiness (1098a7–20)3\n\ni.

The nature of the human function Granting that humans do have a function, what could it be? Aristotle considers a variety of activities of the human soul, drawing on his psychology from De Anima. Some of these he rules out because they are not unique or peculiar to humans. Aristotle is after “the special function of a human being” (1097b34). [Why does Aristotle think that human function must be unique to humans?] • Living is shared by all living things, so isn’t a suitable candidate. • Nutrition and growth are activities shared with plants. • A life of sense perception is shared with every animal. • In NE I.6, Aristotle argues against the Platonic conception of the human good—which is identified with the Form (or “Idea”) of the Good.

The function of humans is to lead a certain kind of life, and excellent humans (good people) are those who do that well. “And so the human good proves to be activity of the soul in accord with excellence, and if there are more than one excellence, then with the best and most complete.” (1098a16–18).\n\nWhat we discover by the end of I.7 is that the good for humans, eudaimonia, amounts to an active life of virtue.

What is the 'Standard Pattern of Socratic Elenchus' used to refute a thesis?,[],"Okay, I can help you understand the standard pattern of Socratic Elenchus. However, I need the course materials to provide you with a detailed explanation. If you can provide the text or notes from your class, I can give you a more accurate and helpful answer.

However, I can still give you a general idea of what the Socratic Elenchus is and how it works.

The Socratic Elenchus, also known as the Socratic Method, is a form of philosophical inquiry that involves a series of questions asked to explore the underlying beliefs of a person, with the goal of stimulating critical thinking and illuminating underlying contradictions.

Here's a general breakdown of the typical pattern:

1.  **Initial Assertion:** Socrates' interlocutor asserts a thesis (a definition or claim about a concept). For example, someone might say, ""Justice is simply telling the truth and paying back what is owed.""
2.  **Socrates' Questioning:** Socrates asks questions that seem simple but are designed to probe the meaning and implications of the initial assertion. He seeks clarification and explores related concepts.
3.  **Interlocutor's Agreement:** The interlocutor agrees to Socrates' questions and assertions, building upon the initial claim. This is a crucial part, as the interlocutor must genuinely agree for the elenchus to proceed.
4.  **Argumentation:** Socrates uses the interlocutor's answers to construct an argument that demonstrates the initial thesis leads to a contradiction or an absurd conclusion.
5.  **Contradiction/Refutation:** Socrates demonstrates that the interlocutor's beliefs are inconsistent, thus refuting the initial thesis. The interlocutor is then left in a state of *aporia* (perplexity), recognizing their lack of knowledge.

The goal isn't necessarily to arrive at a definitive answer but to expose the limits of one's understanding and encourage further inquiry.

Remember, this is a general outline. The specific steps and the nature of the questions can vary depending on the topic and the specific dialogue. If you provide me with the relevant course materials, I can give you a more precise and detailed explanation of the ""standard pattern"" as it's presented in your course.",The standard pattern involves four steps: (1) The interlocutor asserts a target thesis P; (2) Socrates secures agreement to further premises Q and R; (3) Socrates argues that Q and R entail not-P; (4) Socrates claims that P has been shown false (or inconsistent) and not-P is true.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Chunk 2000
