      "question": "What is the Greek word for 'happiness' according to the sources, and what is its alternative translation?",
      "ground_truth": "The Greek word for 'happiness' is 'eudaimonia', which can also be translated as 'flourishing'. It is a compound of 'eu-' (meaning 'good' or 'well') and 'daimon' (meaning 'a minor divinity' or 'guardian spirit')."

      "question": "What are the birth and death years of René Descartes, and in what language was his 'Meditations on First Philosophy' originally published?",
      "ground_truth": "René Descartes was born in 1596 and died in 1650. His work 'Meditations on First Philosophy' was published in Latin in 1641."

    {
      "question": "According to Book I, Chapter 7 of the Nichomachean Ethics, what are the three stages of the Function Argument?",
      "ground_truth": "The three stages are: (i) the existence of a human function, (ii) the nature of the human function, and (iii) the link between the human function and happiness."

    {
      "question": "Define the 'articulation condition' as it relates to Socratic knowledge.",
      "ground_truth": "The articulation condition states that if a person (S) is knowledgeable about a subject (X), then S will be able to offer a Socratically-acceptable definition of X."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Aristotle's formal definition of the soul (psuchē) in 'De Anima'?",
      "ground_truth": "Aristotle defines the soul as the 'first actuality of a natural body that is potentially alive' or, similarly, the 'first actuality of a natural organic body'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Explain Aristotle's reasoning for why a well-ordered life must be organized around a single 'supreme good'.",
      "ground_truth": "Aristotle argues that if we do not choose things for the sake of an ultimate end, the process of desire would go on to infinity, making our desires 'empty and vain'. Furthermore, he suggests that a single ultimate end is necessary to rank various life goals in order of priority when they conflict, allowing for rational decision-making."
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe Descartes' 'Dream Argument' and explain why he believes there is no 'sure sign' of being awake.",
      "ground_truth": "Descartes notes that during sleep, he is often persuaded of ordinary experiences, like sitting by a fire in a dressing gown, while actually lying undressed in bed. He argues that because there are no definitive qualitative signs based on experience alone to distinguish being awake from dreaming, the senses cannot provide a secure foundation for knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'Socratic Elenchus', and what are its two primary purposes according to the sources?",
      "ground_truth": "The Socratic elenchus is a standard pattern of cross-examination where Socrates secures agreement on premises (Q and R) that ultimately entail the negation of the interlocutor's original thesis (P). Its purposes are philosophical (to discover truths about how one ought to live) and therapeutic (to test the interlocutor's virtue and determine if they are living a moral life)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Aristotle use the comparison of an axe to illustrate his concept of the soul?",
      "ground_truth": "Aristotle suggests that if an axe were a natural body, 'being an axe' (its ability to cut) would be its essence and thus its 'soul'. This illustrates that the soul is not a mysterious separate entity, but rather a specific power or ability organized to perform a function, which ceases to exist (except in name) if that power is lost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Socrates argue in the 'Meno' that no one desires what is 'bad'?",
      "ground_truth": "Socrates argues that people only desire things they believe will benefit them. He distinguishes between desiring bad things while knowing they are bad (which he deems impossible) and desiring bad things while believing they are good. He concludes it is not in human nature to prefer what one thinks is bad over what is good."
    },
    {
      "question": "Compare and contrast the views of Plato and Aristotle regarding the relationship between the body and the soul.",
      "ground_truth": "Plato's dualism (as seen in the 'Phaedo') views souls and bodies as radically different, independent, and separable kinds of things. In contrast, Aristotle’s hylomorphism views form (soul) and matter (body) as two aspects of a single individual thing. For Aristotle, the soul and body are interdependent, much like wax and its shape; they constitute a single entity and cannot exist separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Trace the logical progression from the Socratic thesis 'Virtue is Knowledge' to the conclusion that 'No one does harm deliberately'.",
      "ground_truth": "Socrates identifies virtue with moral knowledge. From this, it follows that any person who lacks virtue must also lack moral knowledge, meaning they are acting out of ignorance. Since action based on ignorance is not considered deliberate or voluntary, any wrongdoing (injustice or harm) must be involuntary, as it is a failure of knowledge rather than a deliberate choice to be bad."
    },
    {
      "question": "Synthesize Aristotle's 'Function Argument' with his criteria for 'eudaimonia' to explain why the perfect life consists of activity in accordance with virtue.",
      "ground_truth": "Aristotle establishes that happiness (eudaimonia) is the supreme good because it is final, complete, and self-sufficient. Through the Function Argument, he determines that the unique human function is 'activity of the soul in accord with reason'. Because the virtue of a thing is what enables it to perform its function well, the human good (happiness) must specifically be an 'activity of the soul in accord with excellence' or virtue. Therefore, the life of flourishing is one spent actively exercising human excellence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the distinction between 'external interference' and 'internal interference' structure Descartes' skeptical progression in Meditation 1?",
      "ground_truth": "Descartes first addresses external interference where favorable circumstances (like light or distance) are missing, leading to optical illusions. To find a secure foundation, he adjusts his principle to assume circumstances are favorable. However, he then encounters internal interference, such as madness or hallucination, where the perceiver is incompetent. This leads him to distinguish competent from incompetent perceivers, eventually arriving at the dream argument where no internal or external sign can guarantee competence in distinguishing waking life from sleep."
    },
    {
      "question": "Analyze how Socrates' 'disavowal of knowledge' is reconciled with his claim to 'human wisdom' through the use of the elenchus.",
      "ground_truth": "Socrates uses the elenchus to reveal hidden inconsistencies in his interlocutors' beliefs, proving they lack knowledge. His own 'human wisdom' is the awareness of this fallibility and the recognition of how little he knows compared to infallible divine knowledge. By constantly testing and retesting his own beliefs for coherence, he respects the difficulty of achieving consistency, which he believes is the hallmark of human wisdom even if it does not reach the level of certain, divine knowledge."
