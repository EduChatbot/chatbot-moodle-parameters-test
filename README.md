## Experiments Overview
The core objective of this module was to perform hyperparameter optimization for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. We utilized the **RAGAS** framework and the **LLM-as-a-Judge** paradigm to evaluate system performance across multiple dimensions.

### Key Evaluation Metrics:
* **Faithfulness:** Measuring resistance to hallucinations.
* **Answer Relevancy:** Assessing the alignment between user queries and AI responses.
* **Context Recall & Precision:** Evaluating the efficiency of the retrieval mechanism.
