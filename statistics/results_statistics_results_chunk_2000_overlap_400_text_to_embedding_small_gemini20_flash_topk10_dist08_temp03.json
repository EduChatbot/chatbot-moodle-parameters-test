      "> norm_vec <- rnorm(n=10, mean=5, sd=2)\n> exp_vec <- rexp(n=100, rate=3)\n> pois_vec <- rpois(n=50, lambda=6)\n> unif_vec <- runif(n=20, min=1, max=9)\n> bin_vec <- rbinom(n=20, size=1000, prob=0.7)\n\nSuppose you have a vector v of numbers. To randomly sample, say, 25 of the numbers, use the sample function:\n\n> sample(v, size=25, replace=FALSE)\n\nIf you want to sample with replacement, set the replace argument to TRUE. If you want to generate the same random vector each time you call one of the random functions listed above, pick a “seed” for the random number generator using set.seed, for example set.seed(100).\n\n3.3 Analyzing data\n\nTo compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and sum of a set of numbers, use mean, var, sd, min, max, and sum. There are also rowSum and colSum to find the row and column sums for a matrix.\nTo find the component-wise absolute value and square root of a set of numbers, use abs and sqrt. Correlation\nand covariance for two vectors are computed with cor and cov respectively.\n\nLike other programming languages, you can write if statements, and for and while loops. For instance, here is a simple loop that prints out even numbers between 1 and 10 (%% is the modulo operation):\n\n> for (i in 1:10){\n+ if (i %% 2 == 0){\n+\ncat(paste(i, \"is even.\\n\", sep=\" \"))\n# use paste to concatenate strings\n+\n}\n+ }\n\nThe 1:10 part of the for loop can be specified as a vector. For instance, if you wanted to loop over indices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, you could type for (i in c(1:3,5:7)). To pick out the indices of elements in a vector that satisfy a certain property, use which, for example:\n\n> which(v >= 0)\n# indices of nonnegative elements of v\n> v[which(v >= 0)]\n# nonnegative elements of v\n\n3.4 Plotting data\n\nWe use the Haberman’s Survival data (read into data frame dataset) to demonstrate plotting functions. Each row of data represents a patient who had surgery for breast cancer. The three features are: the age of the patient at the time of surgery",

Use points and lines to add extra points and lines to an existing plot. You can save the plots in a number of different formats; make sure the plot window is on top, and go to “File” then “Save as.”\n\n3.5 Formulas\n\nCertain functions have a “formula” as one of their arguments. Usually this is a way to express the form of a model. Here is a simple example. Suppose you have a response variable y and independent variables x1, x2, and\nx3. To express that y depends linearly on x1, x2, and x3, you would use the formula y ∼ x1 + x2 + x3, where\ny, x1, x2, and x3 are also column names in your data matrix. See Section 3.6 for an example. Type ?formula for details on how to capture nonlinear models.\n\n3.6 Linear regression\n\nOne of the most common modeling approaches in statistical learning is linear regression. In R, use the lm function to generate these models. The general form of a linear regression model is\n\nY = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βkXk + ε,\n\nwhere ε is normally distributed with mean 0 and some variance σ2 .\n\nLet y be a vector of dependent variables, and x1 and x2 be vectors of independent variables. We want to find\nthe coefficients of the linear regression model Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε. The following commands generate the\nlinear regression model and give a summary of it.\n\n> lm_model <- lm(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n> summary(lm_model)\n\nThe vector of coefficients for the model is contained in lm model$coefficients.\n\n4 Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe give the functions corresponding to the algorithms covered in class. Look over the documentation for each function on your own as only the most basic details are given in this tutorial.\n\n6",
      "ost of the following algorithms (as well as linear regression), we would in practice first generate the model using training data, and then predict values for test data. To make predictions, we use the predict function. To see documentation, go to the help page for the algorithm, and then scroll through the Contents menu on the left side to find the corresponding predict function. Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it. See Section 1.2 for installing and loading new packages. Here is an example of how to run the Apriori algorithm using the Mushroom dataset. Note that the dataset must be a binary incidence matrix; the column names should correspond to the “items” that make up the “transactions.” The following commands print out a summary of the results and a list of the generated rules.\n\n> dataset <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Datasets\\\\mushroom.csv\", header = TRUE)\n> mushroom_rules <- apriori(as.matrix(dataset), parameter = list(supp = 0.8, conf = 0.9))\n> summary(mushroom_rules)\n> inspect(mushroom_rules)\n\nYou can modify the parameter settings depending on your desired support and confidence thresholds.\n\n4.3 Logistic Regression\n\nYou do not need to install an extra package for logistic regression. Using the same notation as in Section 3.6, the command is:\n\n> glm_mod <-glm(y ∼ x1+x2, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n\n4.4\nK-Means Clustering\n\nYou do",

      "To avoid this, we (sort of) set the probabilities to a small positive value when there are no data. In particular, we use a “Bayesian shrinkage estimate” of P(X(j) (j)\n= xtest|Y = y˜) where we add some hallucinated examples. There are K\nhallucinated examples spread evenly over the possible values of X(j). K is the\nnumber of distinct values of X(j). The probabilities are pulled toward 1/K. So,\nnow we replace:\n\n1 i (j) (j)\n+ 1\n=\n) [ ˆ x x\n,y =y˜\nP(X(j) (j ]\n= xtest|Y = y˜) =\n\nP\n\nP i test i 1 i\n[yi=y˜] + K\n\nˆP(Y = y˜) =\nP 1 i\n[yi=y˜] + 1\nm + K\nˆ\nThis is called Laplace smoothing. The smoothing for P(Y = y˜) is probably unnecessary and has little to no effect.\n\nNa¨ıve Bayes is not necessarily the best algorithm, but is a good first thing to try, and performs surprisingly well given its simplicity!\n\nThere are extensions to continuous data and other variations too.\n\nPPT Slides\n\n4",
      "Logistic Regression\n\nMIT 15.097 Course Notes Cynthia Rudin\n\nThanks to Ashia Wilson Credit: J.S. Cramer’s “The Origin of Logistic Regression”\n\nOrigins: 19th Century.\n\n• Studying growth of populations and the course of chemical reactions using\n\nd W(t) = βW(t)\ndt ⇒\nW(t) = Aeβt\n\nwhich is a good model for unopposed growth, like the US population’s growth at the time.\n\n• Adolphe Quetelet (1796 - 1874), Belgian astronomer turned statistician,\nknew it produced impossible values and asked his pupil Pierre-Fran¸cois Verhulst (1804-1849) to help him work on a more realistic model. They chose\n\nd W(t) = βW(t) −Φ(W(t))\ndt\n\nto resist further growth, and with the choice of Φ to be a quadratic function, they got:\n\nd W(t) = βW(t)(Ω\ndt −W(t)),\n\nW(t)\nwhere Ωis the saturation limit of W. Writing P(t) =\nas the proportion of Ω saturation limit:\nd P(t) = βP(t)(1 −P(t))\ndt\ne(α+βt)\nP(t) = 1 + e(α+βt)\n\nwhere α is the constant from the integration. Verhulst’s “logistic” function has values between 0 and 1.\n\nDraw the logistic function\n\n1",
      "He published in 3 papers between 1838 and 1847. The first paper demonstrated that the curve agrees very well with the actual course of the population in France, Belgium, Essex, and Russia for periods up to 1833. He did not say how he fitted\nthe curves. In the second paper he tried to fit the logistic to 3 points using 20-30\nyears of data (which in general is a not a great way to get a good model). His estimates of the limiting population Ωof 6.6 million for Belgium and 40 million\nfor France were a little off- these populations are now 11 million for Belgium\nand 65 million for France. In another paper, the estimate was corrected, and they estimated 9.5 million for Belgium (pretty close!).\n\nVerhulst died young in poor heath, and his work was forgotten about, but reinvented in 1920 by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed who were studying population growth of the US. They also tried to fit the logistic function to population growth, and estimated Ωfor the US to be 197 million (the current population is 312 million). Actually, Pearl and collaborators spent 20 years applying the logistic growth curve to almost any living population (fruit flies, humans in North Africa, cantaloupes).\n\nVerhulst’s work was rediscovered just after Pearl and Reed’s first paper in 1920, but they didn’t acknowledge him in their second paper, and only in a footnote in a third paper (by Pearl) in 1922. They cited him in 1923, but didn’t use his terminology and called his papers “long since forgotten.” The name logistic was revived by Yule, in a presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society in 1925.\n\nThere was a lot of debate over whether the logistic function could replace the cdf of the normal distribution. The person who really showed this could happen was\nJoseph Berkson (1899-1982), who was the chief statistician at the Mayo Clinic,\nand who was a collaborator of Reed’s. But because of his personality and attacks on the method of maximum likelihood, controversy ensued... it took until around t",

    "question": "What are the three components that make up the decomposition of the expected prediction error at a fixed point x?",
    "answer": "Okay, great question!\n\nAccording to the course materials, the expected prediction error at a fixed point x, denoted as \\(E_{y,S}[(y - f_S(x))^2]\\), can be decomposed into three components:\n\n1.  **Variance of y around its mean (\\(vary|x(y)\\))**: This term represents the inherent variability in the target variable \\(y\\) given the input \\(x\\). It reflects the noise or randomness in the data and is independent of the choice of the learning algorithm or model.\n\n2.  **Variance of the estimator around its mean (\\(var_S(f_S(x))\\))**: This term measures how much the predictions of the model \\(f_S(x)\\) vary for different training sets \\(S\\). It quantifies the sensitivity of the model to changes in the training data. A high variance indicates that the model is unstable and can produce very different predictions depending on the specific training set used.\n\n3.  **Bias squared (\\(bias(f_S(x))^2\\))**: This term represents the squared difference between the average prediction of the model (\\(\\bar{f}(x)\\)) and the true conditional mean (\\(\\bar{y}\\)). It measures how much the model's average prediction deviates from the true underlying function. A high bias indicates that the model is systematically making inaccurate predictions.\n\nIn summary, the decomposition is:\n\n\\[\nE_{y,S}[(y - f_S(x))^2] = vary|x(y) + var_S(f_S(x)) + bias(f_S(x))^2\n\\]\n\nThis decomposition is crucial for understanding the trade-offs in machine learning. The goal is to choose a model that balances bias and variance to minimize the overall expected prediction error.\n",

      "It turns out that the f ∗ that minimizes the above error is the conditional expec­ tation!\n\nDraw a picture\n\nProposition.\n\nf ∗ (x) = Ey[y|x].\n\nProof. Consider each x separately. For each x there’s a marginal distribution on y. In other words, look at Ey[(y − f(x))2|x] for each x. So, pick an x. For this x, define ¯y to be Ey[y|x]. Now,\n\nEy[(y − f(x))2|x]\n= Ey[(y − y¯ + ¯y − f(x))2|x]\n= Ey[(y − y¯)2|x] + Ey[(¯y − f(x))2|x] + 2Ey[(y − y¯)(¯y − f(x))|x]\n= Ey[(y − y¯)2|x] + (¯y − f(x))2 + 2(¯y − f(x))Ey[(y − y¯)|x]\n= Ey[(y − y¯)2|x] + (¯y − f(x))2\n\nwhere the last step follows from the definition of ¯y.\n\nSo how do we pick f(x)? Well, we can’t do anything about the first term, it doesn’t depend on f(x). The best choice of f(x) minimizes the second term,\nwhich happens at f(x) = y¯, where remember ¯y = Ey[y|x].\n\nSo we know for each x what to choose in order to minimize Ey[(y − f(x))2|x]. To complete the argument, note that:\n\nEx,y[(y − f(x))2] = Ex[Ey[(y − f(x))2|x]]\n\nand we have found the minima of the inside term for each x. •\n\nNote that if we’re interested instead in the absolute loss Ex,y[|y − f(x)|], it is possible to show that the best predictor is the conditional median, that is,\nf(x) = median[y|x].\n\n2",
      "Back to Bias/Variance Decomposition\n\nLet’s think about a situation where we created our function f using data S. Why would we do that of course?\n\nWe have training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), where each example is drawn iid\nfrom D. We want to use S to learn a function fS : X →Y.\n\nWe want to know what the error of fS is on average. In other words, we want to know what Ex,y,S[(y−fS(x))2] is. That will help us figure out how to minimize it.\nThis is going to be a neat result - it’s going to decompose into bias and variance\nterms!\n\nFirst, let’s consider some learning algorithm (which produced fS) and its ex­ pected prediction error:\n\nEx,y,S[(y − fS(x))2].\n\nRemember that the estimator fS is random, since it depends on the randomly drawn training data. Here, the expectation is taken with respect to a new ran­ domly drawn point x, y ∼ D and training data S ∼ Dm .\n\nLet us define the mean prediction of the algorithm at point x to be:\n\n¯f(x) = ES[fS(x)].\n\nIn other words, to get this value, we’d get infinitely many training sets, run the learning algorithm on all of them to get infinite predictions fS(x) for each x.\n\n¯ Then for each x we’d average the predictions to get f(x).\n\nWe can now decompose the error, at a fixed x, as follows:\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2]\n\n= Ey,S[(y − y¯ + ¯y − fS(x))2]\n= Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(¯y − fS(x))2 + 2Ey,S[(y − y¯)(¯y − fS(x))].\n\nThe third term here is zero, since Ey,S[(y−y¯)(¯y−fS(x))] = Ey(y−y¯)ES(¯y−fS(x)),\nand the first part of that is Ey(y − y¯) = 0.\n\n3",
      "The first term is the variance of y around its mean. We don’t have control over that when we choose fS. This term is zero if y is deterministically related to x.\n\nLet’s look at the second term:\n\nES(¯y − fS(x))2\n\n¯ ¯\n= ES(¯y − f(x) + f(x) − fS(x))2\n\n¯ ¯\n= ES(¯y − f(x))2 + ES(f¯(x) − fS(x))2 + 2ES[(¯y − f(x))(f¯(x) − fS(x))]\n\n¯ ¯ The last term is zero, since (¯y − f(x)) is a constant, and f(x) is the mean of ¯ fS(x) with respect to S. Also the first term isn’t random. It’s (¯y − f(x))2 .\n\nPutting things together, what we have is this (reversing some terms):\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2] = Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(f¯(x) − fS(x))2 + (¯y − f¯(x))2 .\n\nIn this expression, the second term is the variance of our estimator around its mean. It controls how our predictions vary around its average prediction. The third term is the bias squared, where the bias is the difference between the av­ erage prediction and the true conditional mean.\n\nWe’ve just proved the following:\n\nTheorem.\n\nFor each fixed x, Ey,S[(y − fS(x))2] = vary|x(y) + varS(fS(x)) + bias(fS(x))2 .\n\nSo\nEx,y,S[(y − fS(x))2] = Ex[vary|x(y) + varS(fS(x)) + bias(fS(x))2].\n\nThat is the bias-variance decomposition.\n\nThe “Bias-Variance” tradeoff: want to choose fS to balance between reducing the\nsecond and third terms in order to make the lowest MSE. We can’t just minimize one or the other, it needs to be a balance. Sometimes, if you are willing to inject some bias, this can allow you to substantially reduce the variance. E.g., modeling with lower degree polynomials, rather than higher degree polynomials.\n\n4",
      "Question: Intuitively, what happens to the second term if fS fits the data per­ fectly every time (overfitting)?\n\nQuestion: Intuitively, what happens to the last two terms if fS is a flat line every time?\n\nThe bottom line: In order to predict well, you need to strike a balance between bias and variance.\n\n• The variance term controls wiggliness, so you’ll want to choose simple func­ tions that can’t yield predictions that are too varied.\n\n• The bias term controls how close the average model prediction is close to the truth, ¯y. You’ll need to pay attention to the data in order to reduce the bias term.\n\n• Since you can’t calculate either the bias or the variance term, what we usually do is just impose some “structure” into the functions we’re fitting with, so the class of functions we are working with is small (e.g., low degree polynomials). We then try to fit the data well using those functions. Hope­ fully this strikes the right balance of wiggliness (variance) and capturing the mean of the data (bias).\n\n• One thing we like to do is make assumptions on the distribution D, or at least on the class of functions that might be able to fit well. Those assumptions each lead to a different algorithm (i.e. model). How well the algorithm works or not depends on how true the assumption is.\n\n• Even when we’re not working with least squares error, we hope a similar idea holds (and will work on proving that later in the course). We’ll use the same type of idea, where we impose some structure, and hope it reduces wiggliness and will still give accurate predictions.\n\nGo back to the other notes!\n\n5",

    "answer": "The \"downward closure\" property of support, in the context of the Apriori algorithm, states:\n\nIf the support of an itemset (a ∪ b) is greater than or equal to the minimum support threshold (θ), then the support of each of its subsets (a and b) must also be greater than or equal to θ.\n\nIn simpler terms, if a combination of items (a ∪ b) is frequent enough to meet the minimum support threshold, then each individual item (a and b) must also be frequent enough on its own.\n\nMathematically:\n\nIf Supp(a ∪ b) ≥ θ, then Supp(a) ≥ θ and Supp(b) ≥ θ\n\nThis property is crucial for the Apriori algorithm's efficiency because it allows the algorithm to prune infrequent itemsets early on. If an itemset doesn't meet the minimum support, all of its supersets can be discarded, reducing the number of itemsets that need to be considered.\n",

      "ost of the following algorithms (as well as linear regression), we would in practice first generate the model using training data, and then predict values for test data. To make predictions, we use the predict function. To see documentation, go to the help page for the algorithm, and then scroll through the Contents menu on the left side to find the corresponding predict function. Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it. See Section 1.2 for installing and loading new packages. Here is an example of how to run the Apriori algorithm using the Mushroom dataset. Note that the dataset must be a binary incidence matrix; the column names should correspond to the “items” that make up the “transactions.” The following commands print out a summary of the results and a list of the generated rules.\n\n> dataset <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Datasets\\\\mushroom.csv\", header = TRUE)\n> mushroom_rules <- apriori(as.matrix(dataset), parameter = list(supp = 0.8, conf = 0.9))\n> summary(mushroom_rules)\n> inspect(mushroom_rules)\n\nYou can modify the parameter settings depending on your desired support and confidence thresholds.\n\n4.3 Logistic Regression\n\nYou do not need to install an extra package for logistic regression. Using the same notation as in Section 3.6, the command is:\n\n> glm_mod <-glm(y ∼ x1+x2, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n\n4.4\nK-Means Clustering\n\nYou do",

We need upper confidence intervals on the proportion that are incorrect. To calculate the upper bounds, calculate confidence intervals on proportions.\n\nThe abstract problem is: say you flip a coin N times, with M heads. (Here N is the number of examples in the leaf, M is the number incorrectly classified.) What is an upper bound for the probability p of heads for the coin?\n\nThink visually about the binomial distribution, where we have N coin flips, and how it changes as p changes:\n\np=0.5\np=0.1\np=0.9\n\nWe want the upper bound to be as large as possible (largest possible p, it’s an upper bound), but still there needs to be a probability α to get as few errors as we got.

      "R for Machine Learning\n\nAllison Chang\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIt is common for today’s scientific and business industries to collect large amounts of data, and the ability to analyze the data and learn from it is critical to making informed decisions. Familiarity with software such as R allows users to visualize data, run statistical tests, and apply machine learning algorithms. Even if you already know other software, there are still good reasons to learn R:\n\n1. R is free. If your future employer does not already have R installed, you can always download it for free, unlike other proprietary software packages that require expensive licenses. No matter where you travel, you can have access to R on your computer.\n\n2. R gives you access to cutting-edge technology. Top researchers develop statistical learning methods\nin R, and new algorithms are constantly added to the list of packages you can download.\n\n3. R is a useful skill. Employers that value analytics recognize R as useful and important. If for no other reason, learning R is worthwhile to help boost your r´esum´e.\n\nNote that R is a programming language, and there is no intuitive graphical user interface with buttons you can click to run different methods. However, with some practice, this kind of environment makes it easy to quickly code scripts and functions for various statistical purposes. To get the most out of this tutorial, follow the examples\nby typing them out in R on your own computer. A line that begins with > is input at the command prompt. We\ndo not include the output in most cases, but you should try out the commands yourself and see what happens. If you type something at the command line and decide not to execute, press the down arrow to clear the line; pressing the up arrow gives you the previous executed command.\n\n1.1 Getting Started\n\nThe R Project website is http://www.r-project.org/. In the menu on the left, click on CRAN under “Download,\nPackages.” Choose a location close to you. At MIT, you can go w",
      "nds yourself and see what happens. If you type something at the command line and decide not to execute, press the down arrow to clear the line; pressing the up arrow gives you the previous executed command.\n\n1.1 Getting Started\n\nThe R Project website is http://www.r-project.org/. In the menu on the left, click on CRAN under “Download,\nPackages.” Choose a location close to you. At MIT, you can go with University of Toronto under Canada. This leads you to instructions on how to download R for Linux, Mac, or Windows.\n\nOnce you open R, to figure out your current directory, type getwd(). To change directory, use setwd (note that the “C:” notation is for Windows and would be different on a Mac):\n\n> setwd(\"C:\\\\Datasets\")\n\n1.2 Installing and loading packages\n\nFunctions in R are grouped into packages, a number of which are automatically loaded when you start R. These include “base,” “utils,” “graphics,” and “stats.” Many of the most essential and frequently used functions come in these packages. However, you may need to download additional packages to obtain other useful functions. For example, an important classification method called Support Vector Machines is contained in a package called\n\n1",
      " script, make\nsure the script window is on top of all others, go to “Edit,” and click “Run all.” Any lines that are run appear in red at the command prompt.\n\n1.4 Help in R\n\nThe functions in R are generally well-documented. To find documentation for a particular function, type ?\nfollowed directly by the function name at the command prompt. For example, if you need help on the “sum” function, type ?sum. The help window that pops up typically contains details on both the input and output for the function of interest. If you are getting errors or unexpected output, it is likely that your input is insufficient or invalid, so use the documentation to figure out the proper way to call the function.\n\nIf you want to run a certain algorithm but do not know the name of the function in R, doing a Google search of R plus the algorithm name usually brings up information on which function to use.\n\n2 Datasets\n\nWhen you test any machine learning algorithm, you should use a variety of datasets. R conveniently comes with its own datasets, and you can view a list of their names by typing data() at the command prompt. For instance, you may see a dataset called “cars.” Load the data by typing data(cars), and view the data by typing cars.\n\nAnother useful source of available data is the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains a couple hundred datasets, mostly from a variety of real applications in science and business. The repository is located at\nhttp://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html. These data are often used by machine learning researchers\nto develop and compare algorithms. We have downloaded a number of datasets for your use, and you can find the text files\n\n.",

To randomly sample, say, 25 of the numbers, use the sample function:\n\n> sample(v, size=25, replace=FALSE)\n\nIf you want to sample with replacement, set the replace argument to TRUE. If you want to generate the same random vector each time you call one of the random functions listed above, pick a “seed” for the random number generator using set.seed, for example set.seed(100).\n\n3.3 Analyzing data\n\nTo compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and sum of a set of numbers, use mean, var, sd, min, max, and sum. There are also rowSum and colSum to find the row and column sums for a matrix.\nTo find the component-wise absolute value and square root of a set of numbers, use abs and sqrt. Correlation\nand covariance for two vectors are computed with cor and cov respectively.\n\nLike other programming languages, you can write if statements, and for and while loops. For instance, here is a simple loop that prints out even numbers between 1 and 10 (%% is the modulo operation):\n\n> for (i in 1:10){\n+ if (i %% 2 == 0){\n+\ncat(paste(i, \"is even.\\n\", sep=\" \"))\n# use paste to concatenate strings\n+\n}\n+ }\n\nThe 1:10 part of the for loop can be specified as a vector. For instance, if you wanted to loop over indices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, you could type for (i in c(1:3,5:7)).

Use points and lines to add extra points and lines to an existing plot. You can save the plots in a number of different formats; make sure the plot window is on top, and go to “File” then “Save as.”\n\n3.5 Formulas\n\nCertain functions have a “formula” as one of their arguments. Usually this is a way to express the form of a model. Here is a simple example. Suppose you have a response variable y and independent variables x1, x2, and\nx3. To express that y depends linearly on x1, x2, and x3, you would use the formula y ∼ x1 + x2 + x3, where\ny, x1, x2, and x3 are also column names in your data matrix. See Section 3.6 for an example. Type ?formula for details on how to capture nonlinear models.\n\n3.6 Linear regression\n\nOne of the most common modeling approaches in statistical learning is linear regression. In R, use the lm function to generate these models. The general form of a linear regression model is\n\nY = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βkXk + ε,\n\nwhere ε is normally distributed with mean 0 and some variance σ2 .\n\nLet y be a vector of dependent variables, and x1 and x2 be vectors of independent variables. We want to find\nthe coefficients of the linear regression model Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε. The following commands generate the\nlinear regression model and give a summary of it.\n\n> lm_model <- lm(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n> summary(lm_model)\n\nThe vector of coefficients for the model is contained in lm model$coefficients.\n\n4 Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe give the functions corresponding to the algorithms covered in class. Look over the documentation for each function on your own as only the most basic details are given in this tutorial.\n\n6",
      "ost of the following algorithms (as well as linear regression), we would in practice first generate the model using training data, and then predict values for test data. To make predictions, we use the predict function. To see documentation, go to the help page for the algorithm, and then scroll through the Contents menu on the left side to find the corresponding predict function. Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it. See Section 1.2 for installing and loading new packages. Here is an example of how to run the Apriori algorithm using the Mushroom dataset.

C4.5 recursively makes choices as to whether to prune on an attribute:\n\n• Option 1: leaving the tree as is\n\n• Option 2: replace that part of the tree with a leaf corresponding to the most frequent label in the data S going to that part of the tree.\n\n• Option 3: replace that part of the tree with one of its subtrees, corresponding to the most common branch in the split\n\nDemo To figure out which decision to make, C4.5 computes upper bounds on the probability of error for each option. I’ll show you how to do that shortly.\n\n• Prob of error for Option 1 ≤UpperBound1\n\n• Prob of error for Option 2 ≤UpperBound2\n\n10",

N for a given branch is just the number of examples in the branch, |Sj|.\n\nSo we can calculate the upper bound on a branch, but it’s still not clear how to calculate the upper bound on a tree. Actually, we calculate an upper confidence bound on each branch on the tree and average it over the relative frequencies of landing in each branch of the tree.

    "question": "How does the Naïve Bayes algorithm handle high-dimensional data where a specific feature value might not appear in the training set for a given class?",
    "answer": "That's a great question! The Naïve Bayes algorithm can struggle with high-dimensional data, especially when certain feature values don't appear in the training data for a particular class. Here's how the algorithm addresses this issue, according to the course materials:\n\n**The Problem: Zero Probability**\n\n*   In Naïve Bayes, you estimate probabilities like P(X(j) = x(j) | Y = y), which is the probability of feature j having value x(j) given class y.\n*   If a particular feature value x(j) *never* occurs in the training data for class y, then the estimated probability P(X(j) = x(j) | Y = y) becomes zero.\n*   Since Naïve Bayes multiplies these probabilities together, even a single zero probability can make the entire result zero, regardless of how strong the other evidence is. This is problematic because it prevents the algorithm from correctly classifying new instances. From the course materials: \"if no training examples from class “spam” have the word “tomato,” we’d never classify a test example containing the word “tomato” as spam!\"\n\n**The Solution: Laplace Smoothing (Adding Hallucinated Examples)**\n\n*   To avoid zero probabilities, Naïve Bayes uses a technique called \"Laplace smoothing\" (also known as additive smoothing).\n*   The idea is to add a small positive value to each feature count, as if you had observed each feature value at least once for each class. This ensures that no probability is ever exactly zero. The course materials state: \"To avoid this, we (sort of) set the probabilities to a small positive value when there are no data.\"\n*   Specifically, you add \"hallucinated examples.\" The course materials state: \"In particular, we use a “Bayesian shrinkage estimate” of P(X(j) = xtest|Y = y˜) where we add some hallucinated examples.\"\n*   The formula for Laplace smoothing is:\n\n    P(X(j) = xtest | Y = y˜) = (P[x(i)(j) = xtest, y(i) = y˜] + 1) / (P[y(i) = y˜] + K)\n\n    Where:\n\n    *   K is the number of distinct values of X(j).\n*   This \"pulls\" the probability estimates towards a non-zero value (1/K), preventing the zero-probability problem.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nNaïve Bayes handles unseen feature values in high-dimensional data by using Laplace smoothing. This technique adds a small count to each feature value, ensuring that no probability is ever zero and allowing the algorithm to make reasonable predictions even when encountering previously unseen features.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

      "Na¨ıve Bayes\n\nMIT 15.097 Course Notes Cynthia Rudin\n\nThanks to S¸eyda Ertekin Credit: Ng, Mitchell\n\nThe Na¨ıve Bayes algorithm comes from a generative model. There is an important distinction between generative and discriminative models. In all cases, we\nwant to predict the label y, given x, that is, we want P(Y = y|X = x). Throughout the paper, we’ll remember that the probability distribution for measure P is\nover an unknown distribution over X × Y.\n\nNa¨ıve Bayes Generative Model\nEstimate P(X = x|Y = y) and P(Y = y)\nand use Bayes rule to get P(Y = y|X = x)\nDiscriminative Model\nDirectly estimate P(Y = y|X = x)\n\nMost of the top 10 classification algorithms are discriminative (K-NN, CART,\nC4.5, SVM, AdaBoost).\n\nFor Na¨ıve Bayes, we make an assumption that if we know the class label y, then we know the mechanism (the random process) of how x is generated.\n\nNa¨ıve Bayes is great for very high dimensional problems because it makes a very strong assumption. Very high dimensional problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality – it’s difficult to understand what’s going on in a high dimensional space without tons of data.\n\nExample: Constructing a spam filter. Each example is an email, each dimension “j” of vector x represents the presence of a word.\n\n1",

The size of the vocabulary could be ∼50,000 words, so we are in a 50,000 dimensional space.\n\nNa¨ıve Bayes makes the assumption that the x(j)’s are conditionally independent\ngiven y. Say y = 1 means spam email, word 2,087 is “buy”, and word 39,831 is\n“price.” Na¨ıve Bayes assumes that if y = 1 (it’s spam), then knowing x(2,087) = 1\n(email contains “buy”) won’t effect your belief about x(39,381) (email contains “price”).\n\nNote: This does not mean x(2,087) and x(39,831) are independent, that is,\n\nP(X(2,087) = x(2,087)) = P(X(2,087) = x(2,087)|X(39,831) = x(39,831)).\n\nIt only means they are conditionally independent given y.

This causes a problem because if even one P(X(j) = xtest|Y = y˜) is zero\nthen the whole right side is zero. In other words, if no training examples from class “spam” have the word “tomato,” we’d never classify a test example containing the word “tomato” as spam!\n\n3",

There are K\nhallucinated examples spread evenly over the possible values of X(j). K is the\nnumber of distinct values of X(j). The probabilities are pulled toward 1/K.

    "question": "Describe the logic behind using the 'Gain Ratio' instead of 'Information Gain' as a splitting criterion in decision trees.",
    "answer": "Okay, I can explain the rationale behind using the Gain Ratio instead of Information Gain.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Information Gain's Bias:** Information Gain tends to favor attributes that result in numerous splits, even if those splits aren't particularly meaningful. Imagine an attribute that splits the data so each branch has only one example. In this case, the entropy after the split would be zero, leading to a maximal Information Gain. However, this is not ideal.\n*   **Gain Ratio to the Rescue:** Gain Ratio addresses this bias by incorporating a \"SplitInfo\" term. The formula is:\n\n    `Gain(S, A) / SplitInfo(S, A)`\n\n    *   We *want* a large `Gain(S, A)`\n    *   We *want* a small `SplitInfo(S, A)`\n\n*   **Understanding SplitInfo:**  `SplitInfo(S, A)` is calculated based on how the data is partitioned by the attribute. The formula is:\n\n    `SplitInfo(S, A) = - Σ (|Sj| / |S|) * log(|Sj| / |S|)`\n\n    Where:\n\n    *   `Sj` is the number of examples in branch `j`.\n    *   `S` is the total number of examples.\n\n    The goal is to have each term in the summation be large. This happens when `|Sj| / |S|` is large, meaning each branch has a substantial number of examples.  In other words, SplitInfo penalizes attributes that split the data into many small partitions.\n\nIn essence, Gain Ratio balances the desire for high information gain with the need for splits that create meaningful and substantial subsets of the data.\n",

If the event has probability 1, we get no information from the occurrence of the event.\n\nWhere did this definition of information come from? Turns out it’s pretty cool. We want to define I so that it obeys all these things:\n\n• I(p) ≥0, I(1) = 0; the information of any event is non-negative, no information from events with prob 1\n\n• I(p1 · p2) = I(p1) + I(p2); the information from two independent events\nshould be the sum of their informations\n\n• I(p) is continuous, slight changes in probability correspond to slight changes in information\n\nTogether these lead to:\n\nI(p2) = 2I(p) or generally I(pn) = nI(p),\n\nthis means that\n\n1\nI(p) = I\n\n(p1/m)m\n= mI\n\np1/m\nso\nI(p) = I\n\np1/m\nm\n\nand more generally,\n\nI\n\npn/m\nn\n=\nI(p). m\nThis is true for any fraction n/m, which includes rationals, so just define it for\nall positive reals:\nI(pa) = aI(p).\n\nThe functions that do this are I(p) = −logb(p) for some b.

    "answer": "Lemma 1 states: cost(C; z) = cost(C, mean(C)) + |C| * ||z - mean(C)||^2.\n\nHere's how to interpret why the mean is the optimal location based on this lemma:\n\n*   **cost(C; z):** This represents the cost of assigning all points in cluster C to a representative located at point z.\n\n*   **cost(C, mean(C)):** This is the cost of assigning all points in cluster C to a representative located at the mean (average) of the points in C.\n\n*   **|C| * ||z - mean(C)||^2:** This term represents the penalty for placing the representative *away* from the mean. |C| is the number of points in the cluster, and ||z - mean(C)||^2 is the squared Euclidean distance between the chosen representative *z* and the mean of the cluster.\n\nThe equation shows that the cost of choosing any point *z* as the cluster representative is equal to the cost of choosing the mean, *plus* a penalty that increases with the distance between *z* and the mean.\n\nTherefore, to *minimize* the cost, you want to make the penalty as small as possible. The only way to make |C| * ||z - mean(C)||^2 equal to zero is to set *z* equal to mean(C). Any other choice of *z* will result in a higher cost.\n\nIn simpler terms, Lemma 1 decomposes the cost function in such a way that it's clear that the cost is minimized when z = mean(C), because that eliminates the second term, which is always non-negative.\n",

Well, we can’t do anything about the first term, it doesn’t depend on f(x). The best choice of f(x) minimizes the second term,\nwhich happens at f(x) = y¯, where remember ¯y = Ey[y|x].\n\nSo we know for each x what to choose in order to minimize Ey[(y − f(x))2|x]. To complete the argument, note that:\n\nEx,y[(y − f(x))2] = Ex[Ey[(y − f(x))2|x]]\n\nand we have found the minima of the inside term for each x. •\n\nNote that if we’re interested instead in the absolute loss Ex,y[|y − f(x)|], it is possible to show that the best predictor is the conditional median, that is,\nf(x) = median[y|x].\n\n2",

    "answer": "C4.5 considers these three options when deciding whether to prune a branch of a decision tree:\n\n1.  **Leaving the tree as is:** Keep the current branch without any changes.\n2.  **Replacing the branch with a leaf:** Replace the entire branch with a single leaf node. This leaf node would represent the most frequent class label in the data subset (S) that reaches that branch.\n3.  **Replacing the branch with one of its subtrees:** Replace the current branch with its most common subtree. This means selecting the most frequent branch within the current branch and using it to replace the entire branch.\n",

To determine which attribute to split, look at “node impurity.”\n\n• Assign leaf nodes the majority vote in the leaf.\n\n• When we get to the bottom, prune the tree to prevent overfitting\n\nWhy is this a good way to build a tree?\n\n1",
      "I have to warn you that C4.5 and CART are not elegant by any means that I can define elegant. But the resulting trees can be very elegant. Plus there are 2 of the top 10 algorithms in data mining that are decision tree algorithms! So it’s worth it for us to know what’s under the hood... even though, well... let’s just say it ain’t pretty.\n\nExample: Will the customer wait for a table?

Origins: Hunt 1962, ID3 of Quinlan 1979 (600 lines of Pascal), C4 (Quinlan 1987). C4.5 is 9000 lines of C (Quinlan 1993). We start with some basic information theory.\n\n3",
      "Back to C4.5 (source material: Russell & Norvig, Mitchell, Quinlan) We consider a “test” split on attribute A at a branch.\n\nIn S we have #pos positives and #neg negatives. For each branch j, we have #posj positives and #negj negatives.\n\nThe training probabilities\n\nin branch j are:\n\n#posj #negj ,\n#posj + #negj #posj + #negj\n\n.\n\nThe Information Gain is calculated like this:\n\nGain(S, A) = expected reduction in entropy due to branching on attribute A\n= original\n\nentropy −entropy after branching #pos #neg\n= H\n,\n#pos + #neg #pos + #neg\n\nJ\n\n−\nX #posj + #negj\n#posj #negj H , .\n#pos + #neg\n\n#posj + #negj #posj + #negj\nj=1\n\nBack to the example with\n\nthe restauran\n\nts.\n\n1 1 2 4 6 2 4\nGain(S, Patrons) = H\n, −\nH([0, 1]) +\nH([1, 0]) +\nH , 2 2 12 12 12\n\n6 6\n\n≈0.541 bits.\n\n2 1 1 2 1 1\nGain(S, Type) = 1 −\nH ,\n+\nH , 12 2 2 12 2 2 4\n\n2 2 4 2 2 ,\n+\nH , 0 bits. 4 4\n\n≈\n\n+\nH 12\n\n12\n\n4 4\n\n6",
      "Actually Patrons has the highest gain among the attributes, and is chosen to be the root of the tree. In general, we want to choose the feature A that maximizes Gain(S, A).\n\nOne problem with Gain is that it likes to partition too much, and favors numerous splits: e.g., if each branch contains 1 example:\n\nThen,\n\nH\n\n#posj #negj ,\n= 0 for all j,\n#posj + #negj #posj + #negj\nso all those negative terms would be zero and we’d\n\nchoose that attribute over all the others.\n\nAn alternative to Gain is the Gain Ratio. We want to have a large Gain, but also we want small partitions. We’ll choose our attribute according to:\n\nGain(S, A) ←want large SplitInfo(S, A) ←want small\n\nwhere SplitInfo(S, A) comes from the partition:\n\nJ Sj Sj\nSplitInfo(S, A) =\nX | | − log |S|\n\n| |\n\nj=1\n|S|\n\nwhere |Sj| is the number of examples in branch j. We want each term in the S sum to be large.

(CART only has binary splits.)\n\nPruning Let’s start with C4.5’s pruning. C4.5 recursively makes choices as to whether to prune on an attribute:\n\n• Option 1: leaving the tree as is\n\n• Option 2: replace that part of the tree with a leaf corresponding to the most frequent label in the data S going to that part of the tree.\n\n• Option 3: replace that part of the tree with one of its subtrees, corresponding to the most common branch in the split\n\nDemo To figure out which decision to make, C4.5 computes upper bounds on the probability of error for each option. I’ll show you how to do that shortly.\n\n• Prob of error for Option 1 ≤UpperBound1\n\n• Prob of error for Option 2 ≤UpperBound2\n\n10",
      "which means we want to choose our upper bound, call it pα), so that it’s the largest possible value of preasonable upper bound that still satisfies that inequality.\n\nThat is,\n\nPM∼Bin(N,pα)(M or fewer errors) ≈α\n\nX M Bin(z, N, pα)\n\nz=0\n≈α\n\nX M N\npz (1 −p )N−z ≈α for M > 0\n(for M = 0 it’s (1 −p )N\nα z α α\nz=0\n≈α)\n\nWe can calculate this numerically without a problem. So now if you give me α\nM and N, I can give you pα. C4.5 uses α = .25 by default. M for a given branch\nis how many misclassified examples are in the branch. N for a given branch is just the number of examples in the branch, |Sj|.\n\nSo we can calculate the upper bound on a branch, but it’s still not clear how to calculate the upper bound on a tree. Actually, we calculate an upper confidence bound on each branch on the tree and average it over the relative frequencies of landing in each branch of the tree. It’s best explained by example:\n\nLet’s consider a dataset of 16 examples describing toys (from the Kranf Site). We want to know if the toy is fun or not.\n\n12\n\n[IMAGE_OCR 1]\nl-a\na ‘Fash diiuton this way",

Then the average is: 1 1\nAve of the upper bounds for tree =\n(6 .206 + 9\n16 ·\n· .143 + 1 · .75) = 3.273 × 16\nLet’s compare that to the error rate of Option 2, where we’d replace the tree\nwith a leaf with 6+9+1 = 16 examples in it, where 15 are positive, and 1 is\n1\nnegative. Calculate pα that solves α = P\nz=0 Bin(z, 16, pα), which is .157. The\naverage is: 1 1\nAve of the upper bounds for leaf =\n16 · .157 = 2.512\n16 × . 16\nSay we had to make the decision amongst only Options 1 and 2. Since 2.512 <\n3.273, the upper bound on the error for Option 2 is lower, so we’ll prune the tree\nto a leaf. Look at the data - does it make sense to do this?\n\n13",
      "CART - Classification and Regression Trees (Breiman, Freedman, Olshen, Stone,\n1984)\n\nDoes only binary splits, not multiway splits (less interpretable, but simplifies splitting criteria).\n\nLet’s do classification first, and regression later. For splitting, CART uses the Gini index. The Gini index again is\n\nvariance of Bin(n, p)\np(1 −p) =\n= variance of Bernoulli(p).\nn For pruning, CART uses “minimal cost complexity.”\n\nEach subtree is assigned a cost. The first term in the cost is a misclassification error. The second term is a regularization term. If we choose C to be large, the tree that minimizes the cost will be sparser.

      "R for Machine Learning\n\nAllison Chang\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIt is common for today’s scientific and business industries to collect large amounts of data, and the ability to analyze the data and learn from it is critical to making informed decisions. Familiarity with software such as R allows users to visualize data, run statistical tests, and apply machine learning algorithms. Even if you already know other software, there are still good reasons to learn R:\n\n1. R is free. If your future employer does not already have R installed, you can always download it for free, unlike other proprietary software packages that require expensive licenses. No matter where you travel, you can have access to R on your computer.\n\n2. R gives you access to cutting-edge technology. Top researchers develop statistical learning methods\nin R, and new algorithms are constantly added to the list of packages you can download.\n\n3. R is a useful skill. Employers that value analytics recognize R as useful and important. If for no other reason, learning R is worthwhile to help boost your r´esum´e.\n\nNote that R is a programming language, and there is no intuitive graphical user interface with buttons you can click to run different methods. However, with some practice, this kind of environment makes it easy to quickly code scripts and functions for various statistical purposes. To get the most out of this tutorial, follow the examples\nby typing them out in R on your own computer. A line that begins with > is input at the command prompt. We\ndo not include the output in most cases, but you should try out the commands yourself and see what happens. If you type something at the command line and decide not to execute, press the down arrow to clear the line; pressing the up arrow gives you the previous executed command.\n\n1.1 Getting Started\n\nThe R Project website is http://www.r-project.org/.

Use points and lines to add extra points and lines to an existing plot. You can save the plots in a number of different formats; make sure the plot window is on top, and go to “File” then “Save as.”\n\n3.5 Formulas\n\nCertain functions have a “formula” as one of their arguments. Usually this is a way to express the form of a model. Here is a simple example. Suppose you have a response variable y and independent variables x1, x2, and\nx3. To express that y depends linearly on x1, x2, and x3, you would use the formula y ∼ x1 + x2 + x3, where\ny, x1, x2, and x3 are also column names in your data matrix. See Section 3.6 for an example. Type ?formula for details on how to capture nonlinear models.\n\n3.6 Linear regression\n\nOne of the most common modeling approaches in statistical learning is linear regression. In R, use the lm function to generate these models. The general form of a linear regression model is\n\nY = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βkXk + ε,\n\nwhere ε is normally distributed with mean 0 and some variance σ2 .\n\nLet y be a vector of dependent variables, and x1 and x2 be vectors of independent variables. We want to find\nthe coefficients of the linear regression model Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε. The following commands generate the\nlinear regression model and give a summary of it.\n\n> lm_model <- lm(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n> summary(lm_model)\n\nThe vector of coefficients for the model is contained in lm model$coefficients.\n\n4 Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe give the functions corresponding to the algorithms covered in class.

Again using the formula, the command is\n\n> cart_model <- rpart(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)), method=\"class\")\n\nYou can use plot.rpart and text.rpart to plot the decision tree.\n\n4.8 AdaBoost\n\nThere are a number of different boosting functions in R. We show here one implementation that uses decision trees as base classifiers. Thus the rpart package should be loaded. Also, the boosting function ada is in the ada\npackage. Let X be the matrix of features, and labels be a vector of 0-1 class labels.

    "question": "Explain how the origins of the logistic function in 19th-century population studies relate to the mathematical necessity of the 'log odds' in modern logistic regression classification.",
    "answer": "Okay, I can certainly help you connect the historical origins of the logistic function to its use in modern logistic regression.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**1. Population Growth and the Logistic Function:**\n\n*   **Early Population Models:** In the 19th century, mathematicians and statisticians like Quetelet and Verhulst were trying to model population growth. Initial models assumed unlimited exponential growth, which wasn't realistic.\n*   **Verhulst's Logistic Model:** Verhulst introduced the logistic function to account for factors that limit population growth, such as resource constraints or competition. His model included a \"saturation limit\" (Ω), representing the maximum sustainable population size.\n*   **The Logistic Equation:** Verhulst's work resulted in the logistic differential equation:\n\n    *   `dP(t)/dt = βP(t)(1 − P(t))`\n\n    *   Where `P(t)` is the proportion of the saturation limit at time `t`, and `β` is a growth rate parameter.\n*   **The Logistic Function (as a Solution):** The solution to this differential equation is the logistic function:\n\n    *   `P(t) = e^(α+βt) / (1 + e^(α+βt))`\n\n    *   This function produces an S-shaped curve, bounded between 0 and 1, representing the proportion of the maximum population.\n\n**2. The Link to Logistic Regression:**\n\n*   **Probabilistic Modeling:** Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an event (Y) belonging to one of two categories (0 or 1) given some input features (x).\n*   **The Need for Bounded Probabilities:** Probabilities *must* be between 0 and 1. A linear combination of features (like in regular linear regression) can take on any real value, so it can't directly represent a probability.\n*   **The \"Odds Ratio\":** The \"odds ratio\" is the probability of an event happening divided by the probability of it not happening: `P(Y=1|x) / P(Y=0|x)`. This transforms probabilities (which are bounded between 0 and 1) into positive real numbers.\n*   **The Logit Link (Log Odds):** To allow a linear combination of features to predict the odds ratio, we take the *log* of the odds ratio:\n\n    *   `ln(P(Y=1|x) / P(Y=0|x)) = λ^T x`\n\n    *   Where `λ` is a vector of coefficients and `x` is the feature vector. This log transformation (the \"logit\" link) maps the odds ratio (positive real numbers) to the entire real number line.\n*   **Connecting to the Logistic Function:** By rearranging the equation above, you can express the probability `P(Y=1|x)` in terms of the logistic function:\n\n    *   `P(Y=1|x) = e^(λ^T x) / (1 + e^(λ^T x))`\n\n    *   This is the same mathematical form as Verhulst's logistic function! In this case, `λ^T x`  acts like the `α + βt` term in the population model, and the function ensures that the predicted probability stays between 0 and 1.\n\n**In essence:** The logistic function, originally developed to model bounded population growth, provides a way to transform a linear combination of features into a probability. The log-odds (logit) transformation is crucial because it allows us to use a linear model to predict a value that, when transformed by the logistic function, yields a valid probability. The math works out such that the predicted probability is modeled by the logistic function.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the connection! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",
    "contexts": [
      "> norm_vec <- rnorm(n=10, mean=5, sd=2)\n> exp_vec <- rexp(n=100, rate=3)\n> pois_vec <- rpois(n=50, lambda=6)\n> unif_vec <- runif(n=20, min=1, max=9)\n> bin_vec <- rbinom(n=20, size=1000, prob=0.7)\n\nSuppose you have a vector v of numbers. To randomly sample, say, 25 of the numbers, use the sample function:\n\n> sample(v, size=25, replace=FALSE)\n\nIf you want to sample with replacement, set the replace argument to TRUE. If you want to generate the same random vector each time you call one of the random functions listed above, pick a “seed” for the random number generator using set.seed, for example set.seed(100).\n\n3.3 Analyzing data\n\nTo compute the mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and sum of a set of numbers, use mean, var, sd, min, max, and sum. There are also rowSum and colSum to find the row and column sums for a matrix.\nTo find the component-wise absolute value and square root of a set of numbers, use abs and sqrt. Correlation\nand covariance for two vectors are computed with cor and cov respectively.\n\nLike other programming languages, you can write if statements, and for and while loops. For instance, here is a simple loop that prints out even numbers between 1 and 10 (%% is the modulo operation):\n\n> for (i in 1:10){\n+ if (i %% 2 == 0){\n+\ncat(paste(i, \"is even.\\n\", sep=\" \"))\n# use paste to concatenate strings\n+\n}\n+ }\n\nThe 1:10 part of the for loop can be specified as a vector. For instance, if you wanted to loop over indices 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7, you could type for (i in c(1:3,5:7)). To pick out the indices of elements in a vector that satisfy a certain property, use which, for example:\n\n> which(v >= 0)\n# indices of nonnegative elements of v\n> v[which(v >= 0)]\n# nonnegative elements of v\n\n3.4 Plotting data\n\nWe use the Haberman’s Survival data (read into data frame dataset) to demonstrate plotting functions.

Use points and lines to add extra points and lines to an existing plot. You can save the plots in a number of different formats; make sure the plot window is on top, and go to “File” then “Save as.”\n\n3.5 Formulas\n\nCertain functions have a “formula” as one of their arguments. Usually this is a way to express the form of a model. Here is a simple example. Suppose you have a response variable y and independent variables x1, x2, and\nx3. To express that y depends linearly on x1, x2, and x3, you would use the formula y ∼ x1 + x2 + x3, where\ny, x1, x2, and x3 are also column names in your data matrix. See Section 3.6 for an example. Type ?formula for details on how to capture nonlinear models.\n\n3.6 Linear regression\n\nOne of the most common modeling approaches in statistical learning is linear regression. In R, use the lm function to generate these models. The general form of a linear regression model is\n\nY = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + · · · + βkXk + ε,\n\nwhere ε is normally distributed with mean 0 and some variance σ2 .\n\nLet y be a vector of dependent variables, and x1 and x2 be vectors of independent variables. We want to find\nthe coefficients of the linear regression model Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ε. The following commands generate the\nlinear regression model and give a summary of it.\n\n> lm_model <- lm(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n> summary(lm_model)\n\nThe vector of coefficients for the model is contained in lm model$coefficients.\n\n4 Machine Learning Algorithms\n\nWe give the functions corresponding to the algorithms covered in class. Look over the documentation for each function on your own as only the most basic details are given in this tutorial.\n\n6",
      "ost of the following algorithms (as well as linear regression), we would in practice first generate the model using training data, and then predict values for test data. To make predictions, we use the predict function. To see documentation, go to the help page for the algorithm, and then scroll through the Contents menu on the left side to find the corresponding predict function. Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it. See Section 1.2 for installing and loading new packages. Here is an example of how to run the Apriori algorithm using the Mushroom dataset. Note that the dataset must be a binary incidence matrix; the column names should correspond to the “items” that make up the “transactions.” The following commands print out a summary of the results and a list of the generated rules.\n\n> dataset <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Datasets\\\\mushroom.csv\", header = TRUE)\n> mushroom_rules <- apriori(as.matrix(dataset), parameter = list(supp = 0.8, conf = 0.9))\n> summary(mushroom_rules)\n> inspect(mushroom_rules)\n\nYou can modify the parameter settings depending on your desired support and confidence thresholds.\n\n4.3 Logistic Regression\n\nYou do not need to install an extra package for logistic regression. Using the same notation as in Section 3.6, the command is:\n\n> glm_mod <-glm(y ∼ x1+x2, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n\n4.4\nK-Means Clustering\n\nYou do",

They chose\n\nd W(t) = βW(t) −Φ(W(t))\ndt\n\nto resist further growth, and with the choice of Φ to be a quadratic function, they got:\n\nd W(t) = βW(t)(Ω\ndt −W(t)),\n\nW(t)\nwhere Ωis the saturation limit of W. Writing P(t) =\nas the proportion of Ω saturation limit:\nd P(t) = βP(t)(1 −P(t))\ndt\ne(α+βt)\nP(t) = 1 + e(α+βt)\n\nwhere α is the constant from the integration. Verhulst’s “logistic” function has values between 0 and 1.\n\nDraw the logistic function\n\n1",
      "He published in 3 papers between 1838 and 1847. The first paper demonstrated that the curve agrees very well with the actual course of the population in France, Belgium, Essex, and Russia for periods up to 1833. He did not say how he fitted\nthe curves. In the second paper he tried to fit the logistic to 3 points using 20-30\nyears of data (which in general is a not a great way to get a good model). His estimates of the limiting population Ωof 6.6 million for Belgium and 40 million\nfor France were a little off- these populations are now 11 million for Belgium\nand 65 million for France. In another paper, the estimate was corrected, and they estimated 9.5 million for Belgium (pretty close!).\n\nVerhulst died young in poor heath, and his work was forgotten about, but reinvented in 1920 by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed who were studying population growth of the US. They also tried to fit the logistic function to population growth, and estimated Ωfor the US to be 197 million (the current population is 312 million). Actually, Pearl and collaborators spent 20 years applying the logistic growth curve to almost any living population (fruit flies, humans in North Africa, cantaloupes).\n\nVerhulst’s work was rediscovered just after Pearl and Reed’s first paper in 1920, but they didn’t acknowledge him in their second paper, and only in a footnote in a third paper (by Pearl) in 1922. They cited him in 1923, but didn’t use his terminology and called his papers “long since forgotten.” The name logistic was revived by Yule, in a presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society in 1925.\n\nThere was a lot of debate over whether the logistic function could replace the cdf of the normal distribution.

    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand the relationship between model complexity, bias, and variance, and how to structure a model for good generalization, according to the course materials.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Bias and Variance Defined**\n\n*   **Bias:** This refers to the error resulting from inaccurate assumptions in the learning algorithm. A high bias suggests the model is making strong assumptions about the data and may be underfitting. It is the difference between the expected prediction of our model and the true value.\n*   **Variance:** This refers to the sensitivity of the model to changes in the training data. High variance suggests the model is fitting the training data too closely and may be overfitting. It quantifies how much the predictions vary for different training sets.\n\n**2. The Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n\n*   The goal is to minimize the total error, and this involves finding the right balance between bias and variance.\n*   **High Variance, Low Bias:** Complex models (e.g., high-degree polynomials) can fit the training data very well, leading to low bias. However, they are also very sensitive to noise in the training data, leading to high variance. This results in overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n*   **High Bias, Low Variance:** Simple models (e.g., low-degree polynomials or even a flat line) are less sensitive to the training data, leading to low variance. However, they may make strong assumptions about the data and may not be able to capture the underlying patterns, leading to high bias. This results in underfitting, where the model performs poorly on both the training data and unseen data.\n\n**3. Model Complexity**\n\n*   Model complexity is directly related to bias and variance.\n*   As model complexity increases, variance tends to increase and bias tends to decrease.\n*   As model complexity decreases, variance tends to decrease and bias tends to increase.\n\n**4. Achieving Good Generalization**\n\n*   **Structural Risk Minimization (SRM):** The course materials mention SRM as an approach to address generalization. SRM suggests that we need some bias in order to learn and generalize, which helps avoid overfitting.\n*   **Regularization:** Impose structure to reduce wiggliness and maintain accurate predictions.\n*   **Model Selection:** The key is to choose a model with the appropriate level of complexity that balances bias and variance.\n*   **Validation:** Use validation techniques (not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but a standard practice) to estimate the performance of different models on unseen data and select the model that generalizes best.\n\n**5. Practical Approaches**\n\n*   **Impose Structure:** Choose a class of functions with limited complexity (e.g., low-degree polynomials).\n*   **Regularized Learning:** Add a penalty term to the loss function that penalizes complex models. This is represented by the \"Regularized Learning Expression\" in the materials:\n\n    *   `R(f(xi), yi) + CReg(f)`\n    *   Where `R(f(xi), yi)` is the loss function (e.g., least squares loss), `Reg(f)` is a regularization term that penalizes model complexity, and `C` is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of the regularization.\n*   **Assumptions:** Make assumptions about the distribution of the data or the class of functions that might fit well. Different assumptions lead to different algorithms (models).\n\n**In summary:** To achieve good generalization, you need to find a model that is complex enough to capture the underlying patterns in the data but not so complex that it overfits the training data. This involves balancing bias and variance, which can be achieved through techniques such as regularization, model selection, and validation.\n",

The bias of estimator θˆ for\nparameter θ is defined as:\n\n• Bias(θˆ,θ) := E(θˆ) − θ, where the expectation is with respect to the distribution\nthat θˆ is constructed from.\n\nAn estimator whose bias is 0 is called unbiased.

Usually we don’t know D (we instead only have data) but for the moment, let’s say we know it. We want to learn a function f : X →Y.\n\nThen if we could choose any f we want, what would we choose? Maybe we’d choose f to minimize the least squares error:\n\nEx,y∼D[(y − f(x))2].\n\n1",
      "Back to Bias/Variance Decomposition\n\nLet’s think about a situation where we created our function f using data S. Why would we do that of course?\n\nWe have training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), where each example is drawn iid\nfrom D. We want to use S to learn a function fS : X →Y.\n\nWe want to know what the error of fS is on average. In other words, we want to know what Ex,y,S[(y−fS(x))2] is. That will help us figure out how to minimize it.\nThis is going to be a neat result - it’s going to decompose into bias and variance\nterms!\n\nFirst, let’s consider some learning algorithm (which produced fS) and its ex­ pected prediction error:\n\nEx,y,S[(y − fS(x))2].\n\nRemember that the estimator fS is random, since it depends on the randomly drawn training data. Here, the expectation is taken with respect to a new ran­ domly drawn point x, y ∼ D and training data S ∼ Dm .\n\nLet us define the mean prediction of the algorithm at point x to be:\n\n¯f(x) = ES[fS(x)].\n\nIn other words, to get this value, we’d get infinitely many training sets, run the learning algorithm on all of them to get infinite predictions fS(x) for each x.\n\n¯ Then for each x we’d average the predictions to get f(x).\n\nWe can now decompose the error, at a fixed x, as follows:\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2]\n\n= Ey,S[(y − y¯ + ¯y − fS(x))2]\n= Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(¯y − fS(x))2 + 2Ey,S[(y − y¯)(¯y − fS(x))].\n\nThe third term here is zero, since Ey,S[(y−y¯)(¯y−fS(x))] = Ey(y−y¯)ES(¯y−fS(x)),\nand the first part of that is Ey(y − y¯) = 0.\n\n3",
      "The first term is the variance of y around its mean. We don’t have control over that when we choose fS. This term is zero if y is deterministically related to x.\n\nLet’s look at the second term:\n\nES(¯y − fS(x))2\n\n¯ ¯\n= ES(¯y − f(x) + f(x) − fS(x))2\n\n¯ ¯\n= ES(¯y − f(x))2 + ES(f¯(x) − fS(x))2 + 2ES[(¯y − f(x))(f¯(x) − fS(x))]\n\n¯ ¯ The last term is zero, since (¯y − f(x)) is a constant, and f(x) is the mean of ¯ fS(x) with respect to S. Also the first term isn’t random. It’s (¯y − f(x))2 .\n\nPutting things together, what we have is this (reversing some terms):\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2] = Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(f¯(x) − fS(x))2 + (¯y − f¯(x))2 .\n\nIn this expression, the second term is the variance of our estimator around its mean. It controls how our predictions vary around its average prediction. The third term is the bias squared, where the bias is the difference between the av­ erage prediction and the true conditional mean.\n\nWe’ve just proved the following:\n\nTheorem.\n\nFor each fixed x, Ey,S[(y − fS(x))2] = vary|x(y) + varS(fS(x)) + bias(fS(x))2 .\n\nSo\nEx,y,S[(y − fS(x))2] = Ex[vary|x(y) + varS(fS(x)) + bias(fS(x))2].\n\nThat is the bias-variance decomposition.\n\nThe “Bias-Variance” tradeoff: want to choose fS to balance between reducing the\nsecond and third terms in order to make the lowest MSE. We can’t just minimize one or the other, it needs to be a balance. Sometimes, if you are willing to inject some bias, this can allow you to substantially reduce the variance. E.g., modeling with lower degree polynomials, rather than higher degree polynomials.\n\n4",
      "Question: Intuitively, what happens to the second term if fS fits the data per­ fectly every time (overfitting)?\n\nQuestion: Intuitively, what happens to the last two terms if fS is a flat line every time?\n\nThe bottom line: In order to predict well, you need to strike a balance between bias and variance.\n\n• The variance term controls wiggliness, so you’ll want to choose simple func­ tions that can’t yield predictions that are too varied.\n\n• The bias term controls how close the average model prediction is close to the truth, ¯y. You’ll need to pay attention to the data in order to reduce the bias term.\n\n• Since you can’t calculate either the bias or the variance term, what we usually do is just impose some “structure” into the functions we’re fitting with, so the class of functions we are working with is small (e.g., low degree polynomials). We then try to fit the data well using those functions. Hope­ fully this strikes the right balance of wiggliness (variance) and capturing the mean of the data (bias).\n\n• One thing we like to do is make assumptions on the distribution D, or at least on the class of functions that might be able to fit well. Those assumptions each lead to a different algorithm (i.e. model). How well the algorithm works or not depends on how true the assumption is.\n\n• Even when we’re not working with least squares error, we hope a similar idea holds (and will work on proving that later in the course). We’ll use the same type of idea, where we impose some structure, and hope it reduces wiggliness and will still give accurate predictions.\n\nGo back to the other notes!\n\n5",

    "question": "Contrast the splitting and pruning criteria used by the C4.5 and CART algorithms.",
    "answer": "Okay, I can help you understand the differences between the C4.5 and CART algorithms, specifically focusing on their splitting and pruning criteria.\n\n**Splitting Criteria**\n\n*   **C4.5:** This algorithm uses **information gain** for splitting. Information gain evaluates which attribute provides the most information for classifying the data. However, a problem with information gain is that it favors attributes with numerous splits, even if those splits don't generalize well. To address this, C4.5 uses **Gain Ratio**, which adjusts for the number and size of splits by dividing the information gain by the SplitInfo.\n\n*   **CART:** CART (Classification and Regression Trees) employs the **Gini index** as its splitting criterion. The Gini index measures the impurity of a node. CART aims to create binary splits, which simplifies the splitting criteria but may be less interpretable than multiway splits.\n\n**Pruning Criteria**\n\n*   **C4.5:** C4.5 uses a statistical method to estimate the upper bound on the probability of error. It considers three options:\n\n    1.  Leaving the tree as is.\n    2.  Replacing a subtree with a leaf node representing the most frequent class.\n    3.  Replacing a subtree with its most common branch.\n\n    C4.5 computes an upper bound on the probability of error for each option and chooses the option with the lowest upper bound.\n\n*   **CART:** CART uses a technique called \"minimal cost complexity\" pruning. This method adds a regularization term to the misclassification error. The cost function includes two components: misclassification error and a penalty for the number of leaves in the subtree. By adjusting the cost complexity parameter C, CART creates a sequence of nested subtrees. The optimal value of C is typically chosen using cross-validation on a held-out dataset.\n\nIn summary, C4.5 uses information gain ratio for splitting and an upper bound estimation for pruning, while CART uses the Gini index for splitting and minimal cost complexity pruning.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the differences in splitting and pruning criteria between C4.5 and CART. Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

    "question": "How does the CART algorithm apply the principle of least squares to both the construction of regression trees and the assignment of values to leaf nodes?",
    "answer": "Okay, I can explain how CART (Classification and Regression Trees) uses the principle of least squares.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**1. Regression Tree Construction (Splitting):**\n\n*   **Goal:** CART aims to find the attribute and split point that best divide the data into increasingly homogeneous groups (i.e., groups with similar target variable values).\n*   **Least Squares in Splitting:** For each potential split (attribute A and split point s), CART calculates the following, based on the least squares principle:\n\n    *   It tries to minimize the sum of squared differences between the actual values (yi) and the average value in each resulting leaf node.\n    *   The formula in the notes represents this:\n\n    ```\n    min_{A, s} [ min_{C1}  \\sum_{i \\in \\{x | x(A) \\le s\\}} (y_i - C1)^2   +  min_{C2} \\sum_{i \\in \\{x | x(A) > s\\}} (y_i - C2)^2 ]\n    ```\n\n    *   In simpler terms, it's finding the split that minimizes the total squared error in the two resulting groups.\n    *   `C1` represents the predicted value for the left leaf (where the attribute A is less than or equal to the split point s), and `C2` represents the predicted value for the right leaf (where the attribute A is greater than the split point s).\n    *   The algorithm searches for the attribute `A` and split point `s` that result in the lowest overall sum of squared errors across the two child nodes.\n\n**2. Assigning Values to Leaf Nodes:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Once the tree structure is determined, each leaf node needs a predicted value.\n*   **Least Squares in Leaf Assignment:** CART assigns a value to each leaf node by minimizing the sum of squared errors *within that leaf*.\n    *   The notes show this with the equation:\n\n    ```\n    Rtrain(f) = \\sum_{leaves j} \\sum_{i \\in leaf j} (y_i - f_j)^2\n    ```\n\n    *   Where `fj` is the constant value assigned to leaf `j`. To find the optimal `fj`, we take the derivative of `Rtrain(f)` with respect to `fj`, set it to zero, and solve for `fj`. This results in `fj` being the average of the target variable values in leaf `j`:\n\n    ```\n    fj = (1 / |Sj|) * \\sum_{i \\in leaf j} y_i = ȳ_{Sj}\n    ```\n\n    *   In other words, the predicted value for a leaf is simply the average of the target variable (`y`) values of all the training examples that fall into that leaf. This average is the value that minimizes the sum of squared differences in the leaf.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\n*   **Splitting:** CART uses the least squares principle to find the best splits by minimizing the sum of squared errors across the resulting child nodes.\n*   **Leaf Values:** CART uses the least squares principle to assign the best predicted value to each leaf, which turns out to be the average of the target variable values for the training examples in that leaf.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies how CART uses the principle of least squares! Let me know if you have any further questions.\n",

      "ost of the following algorithms (as well as linear regression), we would in practice first generate the model using training data, and then predict values for test data. To make predictions, we use the predict function. To see documentation, go to the help page for the algorithm, and then scroll through the Contents menu on the left side to find the corresponding predict function. Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it. See Section 1.2 for installing and loading new packages. Here is an example of how to run the Apriori algorithm using the Mushroom dataset. Note that the dataset must be a binary incidence matrix; the column names should correspond to the “items” that make up the “transactions.” The following commands print out a summary of the results and a list of the generated rules.\n\n> dataset <- read.csv(\"C:\\\\Datasets\\\\mushroom.csv\", header = TRUE)\n> mushroom_rules <- apriori(as.matrix(dataset), parameter = list(supp = 0.8, conf = 0.9))\n> summary(mushroom_rules)\n> inspect(mushroom_rules)\n\nYou can modify the parameter settings depending on your desired support and confidence thresholds.\n\n4.3 Logistic Regression\n\nYou do not need to install an extra package for logistic regression. Using the same notation as in Section 3.6, the command is:\n\n> glm_mod <-glm(y ∼ x1+x2, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n\n4.4\nK-Means Clustering\n\nYou do",
      "4.6 Na¨ıve Bayes\n\nInstall and load the e1071 package. Using the same notation as in Section 3.6, the command is:\n\n> nB_model <- naiveBayes(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)))\n\n4.7 Decision Trees (CART)\n\nCART is implemented in the rpart package. Again using the formula, the command is\n\n> cart_model <- rpart(y ∼ x1 + x2, data=as.data.frame(cbind(y,x1,x2)), method=\"class\")\n\nYou can use plot.rpart and text.rpart to plot the decision tree.\n\n4.8 AdaBoost\n\nThere are a number of different boosting functions in R. We show here one implementation that uses decision trees as base classifiers. Thus the rpart package should be loaded. Also, the boosting function ada is in the ada\npackage. Let X be the matrix of features, and labels be a vector of 0-1 class labels. The command is\n\n> boost_model <- ada(x=X, y=labels)\n\n4.9 Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n\nThe SVM algorithm is in the e1071 package. Let X be the matrix of features, and labels be a vector of 0-1 class\nlabels. Let the regularization parameter be C. Use the following commands to generate the SVM model and view details:\n\n> svm_model <- svm(x=X, y=as.factor(labels), kernel =\"radial\", cost=C)\n> summary(svm_model)\n\nThere are a variety of parameters such as the kernel type and value of the C parameter, so check the documentation on how to alter them.\n\n8",

      "Actually Patrons has the highest gain among the attributes, and is chosen to be the root of the tree.
