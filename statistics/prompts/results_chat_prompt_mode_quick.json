They chose\n\nd W(t) = βW(t) −Φ(W(t))\ndt\n\nto resist further growth, and with the choice of Φ to be a quadratic function, they got:\n\nd W(t) = βW(t)(Ω\ndt −W(t)),\n\nW(t)\nwhere Ωis the saturation limit of W. Writing P(t) =\nas the proportion of Ω saturation limit:\nd P(t) = βP(t)(1 −P(t))\ndt\ne(α+βt)\nP(t) = 1 + e(α+βt)\n\nwhere α is the constant from the integration. Verhulst’s “logistic” function has values between 0 and 1.\n\nDraw ",
      "He published in 3 papers between 1838 and 1847. The first paper demonstrated that the curve agrees very well with the actual course of the population in France, Belgium, Essex, and Russia for periods up to 1833. He did not say how he fitted\nthe curves. In the second paper he tried to fit the logistic to 3 points using 20-30\nyears of data (which in general is a not a great way to get a good model). His estimates of the limiting population Ωof 6.6 million for Belgium and 40 million\nfor France were a little off- these populations are now 11 million for Belgium\nand 65 million for France. In another paper, the estimate was corrected, and they estimated 9.5 million for Belgium (pretty close!).\n\nVerhulst died young in poor heath, and his work was forgotten about, but reinvented in 1920 by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed who were studying population growth of the US.

Actually, Pearl and collaborators spent 20 years applying the logistic growth curve to almost any living population (fruit flies, humans in North Africa, cantaloupes).\n\nVerhulst’s work was rediscovered just after Pearl and Reed’s first paper in 1920, but they didn’t acknowledge him in their second paper, and only in a footnote in a third paper (by Pearl) in 1922. They cited him in 1923, but didn’t use his terminology and called his papers “long since forgotten.” The name logistic was revived by Yule, in a presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society in 1925.\n\nThere was a lot of debate over whether the logistic function could replace the cdf of the normal distribution.

      "Back to Bias/Variance Decomposition\n\nLet’s think about a situation where we created our function f using data S. Why would we do that of course?\n\nWe have training set S = (x1, y1), . . . , (xm, ym), where each example is drawn iid\nfrom D. We want to use S to learn a function fS : X →Y.\n\nWe want to know what the error of fS is on average. In other words, we want to know what Ex,y,S[(y−fS(x))2] is. That will help us figure out how to minimize it.\nThis is going to be a neat result - it’s going to decompose into bias and variance\nterms!\n\nFirst, let’s consider some learning algorithm (which produced fS) and its ex­ pected prediction error:\n\nEx,y,S[(y − fS(x))2].\n\nRemember that the estimator fS is random, since it depends on the randomly drawn training data. Here, the expectation is taken with respect to a new ran­ domly drawn point x, y ∼ D and training data S ∼ Dm .",
      "r that the estimator fS is random, since it depends on the randomly drawn training data. Here, the expectation is taken with respect to a new ran­ domly drawn point x, y ∼ D and training data S ∼ Dm .\n\nLet us define the mean prediction of the algorithm at point x to be:\n\n¯f(x) = ES[fS(x)].\n\nIn other words, to get this value, we’d get infinitely many training sets, run the learning algorithm on all of them to get infinite predictions fS(x) for each x.\n\n¯ Then for each x we’d average the predictions to get f(x).\n\nWe can now decompose the error, at a fixed x, as follows:\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2]\n\n= Ey,S[(y − y¯ + ¯y − fS(x))2]\n= Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(¯y − fS(x))2 + 2Ey,S[(y − y¯)(¯y − fS(x))].\n\nThe third term here is zero, since Ey,S[(y−y¯)(¯y−fS(x))] = Ey(y−y¯)ES(¯y−fS(x)),\nand the first part of that is Ey(y − y¯) = 0.\n\n3",
      "S. Also the first term isn’t random. It’s (¯y − f(x))2 .\n\nPutting things together, what we have is this (reversing some terms):\n\nEy,S[(y − fS(x))2] = Ey(y − y¯)2 + ES(f¯(x) − fS(x))2 + (¯y − f¯(x))2 .\n\nIn this expression, the second term is the variance of our estimator around its mean. It controls how our predictions vary around its average prediction. The third term is the bias squared, where the bias is the difference between the av­ erage prediction and the true conditional mean.\n\nWe’ve just proved the following:\n\nTheorem.\n\nFor each fixed x, Ey,S[(y − fS(x))2] = vary|x(y) + varS(fS(x)) + bias(fS(x))2 .",

We can’t just minimize one or the other, it needs to be a balance. Sometimes, if you are willing to inject some bias, this can allow you to substantially reduce the variance.

      "R for Machine Learning\n\nAllison Chang\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIt is common for today’s scientific and business industries to collect large amounts of data, and the ability to analyze the data and learn from it is critical to making informed decisions. Familiarity with software such as R allows users to visualize data, run statistical tests, and apply machine learning algorithms. Even if you already know other software, there are still good reasons to learn R:\n\n1. R is free. If your future employer does not already have R installed, you can always download it for free, unlike other proprietary software packages that require expensive licenses. No matter where you travel, you can have access to R on your computer.\n\n2. R gives you access to cutting-edge technology. Top researchers develop statistical learning methods\nin R, and new algorithms are constantly added to the list of packages you can download.\n\n3. R is a useful skill.

Employers that value analytics recognize R as useful and important. If for no other reason, learning R is worthwhile to help boost your r´esum´e.\n\nNote that R is a programming language, and there is no intuitive graphical user interface with buttons you can click to run different methods. However, with some practice, this kind of environment makes it easy to quickly code scripts and functions for various statistical purposes. To get the most out of this tutorial, follow the examples\nby typing them out in R on your own computer. A line that begins with > is input at the command prompt. We\ndo not include the output in most cases, but you should try out the commands yourself and see what happens.

For example, if you need help on the “sum” function, type ?sum. The help window that pops up typically contains details on both the input and output for the function of interest. If you are getting errors or unexpected output, it is likely that your input is insufficient or invalid, so use the documentation to figure out the proper way to call the function.\n\nIf you want to run a certain algorithm but do not know the name of the function in R, doing a Google search of R plus the algorithm name usually brings up information on which function to use.\n\n2 Datasets\n\nWhen you test any machine learning algorithm, you should use a variety of datasets. R conveniently comes with its own datasets, and you can view a list of their names by typing data() at the command prompt. For instance, you may see a dataset called “cars.” Load the data by typing data(cars)",

Or simply type ?predict.name, where name is the function corresponding to the algorithm. Typically, the first argument is the variable in which you saved the model, and the second argument is a matrix or data frame of test data. Note that when you call the function, you can just type predict instead of predict.name. For instance, if we were to predict for the linear regression model above, and x1 test and x2 test are vectors containing test data, we can use the command\n\n> predicted_values <- predict(lm_model, newdata=as.data.frame(cbind(x1_test, x2_test)))\n\n4.2 Apriori\n\nTo run the Apriori algorithm, first install the arules package and load it.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Problem with Information Gain:** Information Gain tends to prefer attributes that create many partitions, even if those partitions result in only one example per branch. This is because when each branch contains very few examples, the entropy after branching is low, leading to a high Information Gain, but not necessarily a meaningful split (According to the Lecture Notes on Decision Trees).\n*   **Gain Ratio to the Rescue:** The Gain Ratio balances the Information Gain by considering the 'SplitInfo'. It aims for a large Gain, but also wants small partitions. The formula is Gain(S, A) / SplitInfo(S, A) (According to the Lecture Notes on Decision Trees).\n*   **SplitInfo Explained:** SplitInfo(S, A) measures the \"cost\" of the split itself. A high SplitInfo means that the attribute is splitting the data into many small partitions, which penalizes the Gain Ratio. The formula for SplitInfo(S, A) is provided in the Lecture Notes on Decision Trees.\n*   **In essence:** Gain Ratio adjusts the Information Gain by the SplitInfo to prevent the selection of attributes that create many small, potentially uninformative partitions (According to the Lecture Notes on Decision Trees).",

    "answer": "The origins of the logistic function in 19th-century population studies are directly related to the mathematical necessity of the 'log odds' in modern logistic regression. Here's how:\n\n*   **Early Population Modeling:** Adolphe Quetelet tasked Pierre-François Verhulst with creating a more realistic population growth model than the simple exponential model. Verhulst developed the logistic function: P(t) = e(α+βt) / (1 + e(α+βt)), which has values between 0 and 1 (see section \"Logistic Regression\").\n*   **Verhulst's Logistic Function:** Verhulst's logistic function was designed to model the proportion of saturation in a population, ensuring values between 0 and 1, representing realistic population limits (see section \"Logistic Regression\").\n*   **Modern Logistic Regression:** In modern logistic regression, we model the probability P(Y = 1|x, λ) using a similar function, ensuring the output is between 0 and 1. The \"odds ratio\" (P(Y = 1|x, λ) / P(Y = ˜0|x, λ)) transforms probabilities into positive real numbers, and then the log transform turns it into any real number, allowing a linear combination of feature values (λTx) to model the log odds (see section \"Logistic Regression\").\n*   **Mathematical Necessity:** The log odds (logit) is mathematically necessary because it links a linear predictor (λTx) to a probability (P(Y = 1|x, λ)) that must be bounded between 0 and 1. The logistic function, derived from the exponential function, naturally arises when modeling probabilities this way (see section \"Logistic Regression\").\n\nIn essence, the logistic function's original purpose of modeling proportions (bounded between 0 and 1) in population studies mirrors its role in logistic regression, where it ensures predicted probabilities are also bounded between 0 and 1. The log odds is the mathematical tool that allows us to use a linear combination of features to predict these probabilities.",

Another example is the value 1 −max(p, 1 −p).1\n\n1If an event has prob p of success, this value is the proportion of time you guess incorrectly if you classify the\nevent to happen when p > 1/2 (and classify the event not to happen when p ≤1/2).\n\n9",

(CART only has binary splits.)\n\nPruning Let’s start with C4.5’s pruning. C4.5 recursively makes choices as to whether to prune on an attribute:\n\n• Option 1: leaving the tree as is\n\n• Option 2: replace that part of the tree with a leaf corresponding to the most frequent label in the data S going to that part of the tree.\n\n• Option 3: replace that part of the tree with one of its subtrees, corresponding to the most common branch in the split\n\nDemo To figure out which decision to make, C4.5 computes upper bounds on the probability of error for each option. I’ll show you how to do that shortly.\n\n• Prob of error for Option 1 ≤UpperBound1\n\n• Prob of error for Option 2 ≤UpperBound2\n\n10",
      "CART - Classification and Regression Trees (Breiman, Freedman, Olshen, Stone,\n1984)\n\nDoes only binary splits, not multiway splits (less interpretable, but simplifies splitting criteria).\n\nLet’s do classification first, and regression later. For splitting, CART uses the Gini index. The Gini index again is\n\nvariance of Bin(n, p)\np(1 −p) =\n= variance of Bernoulli(p).\nn For pruning, CART uses “minimal cost complexity.”\n\nEach subtree is assigned a cost. The first term in the cost is a misclassification error. The second term is a regularization term. If we choose C to be large, the tree that minimizes the cost will be sparser. If C is small, the tree that minimizes the cost will have better training accuracy.\n\nX\n1[yi=leaf’s class] + C [#leaves in subtree] .",

Once the partitions are set, CART assigns each leaf node a constant value fj. To minimize the empirical training error (least squares loss), the derivative of the error with respect to fj is set to zero, which mathematically results in fj being the sample average (mean) of the labels for the examples in that specific leaf.",
